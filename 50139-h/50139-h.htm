<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2></div>


<p>A translation of the portion of the
"Handbuch der Parfümerie-und Toiletteseifenfabrikation,"
edited by Dr. <span class="smcap">C. Deite</span>, relating
to perfumery and cosmetics, is presented to
the English reading public with the full confidence
that it will not only fill a useful place
in technical literature, but will also prove&mdash;for
what it is chiefly intended&mdash;a ready book of
reference and a practical help and guide for
the perfumer's laboratory. The names of the
editor and his co-workers are a sufficient
guaranty of its value and practical usefulness,
they all being experienced men, well schooled
each in the particular branch of the industry,
the treatment of which has been assigned to
him.</p>

<p>The most suitable and approved formulæ,
tested by experience, have been given; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
special attention has been paid to the description
of the raw materials, as well as to the
various methods of testing them, the latter
being of special importance, since in no other
industry has the manufacturer to contend with
such gross and universal adulteration of raw
materials.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the additions made here and
there by the translator, as well as the portion
relating to the manufacture of "Fruit Ethers,"
added by him, may contribute to the interest
and usefulness of the treatise.</p>

<p>Finally, it remains only to be stated that,
with their usual liberality, the publishers have
spared no expense in the proper illustration
and the mechanical production of the book;
and, as is their universal practice, have caused
it to be provided with a copious table of contents
and a very full index, which will add
additional value by rendering any subject in it
easy and prompt of reference.</p>

<p class="ph1">A PRACTICAL TREATISE<br />

<span class="xs">ON THE</span><br />

MANUFACTURE OF PERFUMERY.</p>
<hr class="small" />


<hr class="chap" /><div class="chapter"><h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2></div>

<p class="subh">HISTORICAL NOTICE OF PERFUMERY.</p>


<p>Nature has implanted in man the instinct of finding
the odor accompanying decay and putrefaction insufferable,
of fleeing from it, and of going in quest of fragrant
odors. Hence, in ancient times, perfume substances
were highly esteemed, and an offering of them was
considered a sign of the most profound reverence and
homage. The early nations of the Orient especially
used perfume substances in such profusion that the consumption
of them by the finest lady of to-day must be
called a comparatively moderate one. This may, however,
be readily explained, for, on the one hand, the
majority of plants which produce the most agreeable
perfumes in larger quantity are indigenous to the
Orient; and, on the other, the excessive exhalations
from the human body, caused by the hot climate, forced
the people to search for means to remove, or at least to
cover, the disagreeable odor arising therefrom.</p>

<p>Since fragrant odors were agreeable to human beings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
it was believed that they must be welcome also to the
gods, and, to honor them, perfume substances were burned
upon the altars. Besides, as an offering to the gods, perfume
substances were extensively used by many nations,
especially by the Egyptians, for embalming the dead, the
process employed by the latter having been transmitted
to us by the ancient authors Herodotus and Diodorus.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a desire for ornamentation and to give
to the face and body as pleasing an appearance as possible,
is common to all mankind. To be sure, the ideas
of what constitutes beauty in this respect have varied
at different times and among the various nations. But,
independent of the savage races, who consider painting
and tattooing the body and face an embellishment,
and taking into consideration only the earliest civilized
nations, it is astonishing how many arts of the toilet
have been preserved from the most ancient historical
times up to the present. "In the most ancient historical
times, people perfumed and painted, frizzed, curled,
and dyed the hair as at present, and, in fact, the same
cosmetics, only slightly augmented, which were in use
hundreds, nay, thousands, of years ago are still employed
to-day."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is especially woman, who everywhere exercises
the arts of the toilet, while, with the exception of
perfumes and agents for the hair, man is but seldom
referred to as making use of cosmetics. The young
girls of ancient Egypt used red and white paints, colored
their pale lips, and anointed their hair with sweet-scented
oils; they dyed their eyelashes and eyelids black
to impart a brighter lustre to the glance of the eye, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the mother of the wife of the first king of Egypt is said
to have already composed a receipt for a hair-dye.</p>

<p>From the Egyptians, the practices of the toilet, like
many other things, were transmitted to the Jews. In
Egypt, the Hebrew woman had known the sweet-scented
flower of the henna bush, and, finding it also in Judea, it
served her as a perfume. In the Bible the henna flower
is called <i lang="he">kopher</i>, in Greek <i lang="el">kypros</i>, and the Cyprian salve,
mentioned by Pliny, was prepared by boiling henna
flowers in oil and then expressing them.</p>

<p>Painting the face was also practised by the Hebrew
women, reference being made to it in II. Kings ix. 30,
and Jeremiah v. 30, while painting of the eyes is mentioned
in Ezekiel xxiii. 40.</p>

<p>The number of perfume substances known to the
ancient Hebrews was but a limited one, they consisting,
besides the above-mentioned henna flower, chiefly of a
few gum-resins, especially bdellium, olibanum and
myrrh.</p>

<p>In ancient times olibanum was, without doubt, the
most important perfume-substance. It was introduced
into commerce by the Phoenicians, and, like many other
substances, it received from them its name, which was
adopted by other nations. Thus, the Hebrews called
the tree <i lang="he">lebonah</i>, the Arabs, <i lang="ar">lubah</i>, while the Greeks
named it, λιβανός and the resin derived from it, the celebrated
frankincense of the ancients, λιβανωτόςτς, Latin, <i lang="la">olibanum</i>.
Regarding the mode of gaining the olibanum,
some curious ideas prevailed in ancient times. Thus,
Herodotus writes: "Arabia is the only country in which
olibanum grows, as well as myrrh, cassia, cinnamon and
lederum. With the exception of myrrh, the Arabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
encounter many difficulties in procuring these products.
Olibanum they obtain by burning styrax, for every olibanum
tree is guarded by a number of small-sized
winged serpents of a variegated appearance, which can
be driven away by nothing but styrax vapors." According
to Pliny, who gives a very full account of olibanum,
<i lang="la">Arabia felix</i> received its by-name from the abundance of
olibanum and myrrh found there. He states that olibanum
grows in no other country besides Arabia, but it
is not found in every part of it. About in the centre,
upon a high mountain, he continues, is the country of
the Atramites, a province of the Sabeans, from which the
olibanum region is distant about eight days' journey.
It is called Saba and is everywhere rendered inaccessible
by mountains, a narrow defile, through which the export
is carried on, leading into an adjoining province inhabited
by the Mineans. In Saba itself were not more than
300 families, called the saints, who claimed the cultivation
of olibanum as a right of heritage. When making
the incisions in the trees, and while gathering the olibanum,
the men were prohibited from having intercourse
with women and from attending funerals. Notwithstanding
the fact that the Romans carried on war in Arabia,
none of them had ever seen an olibanum tree. When
there was less chance of selling the olibanum, it was
gathered but once in the year, but since the increase in
the demand, it was gathered twice, first in the fall and
again in the spring, the incisions in the trees having been
made during the winter. The collected olibanum was
brought upon camels to Sabota, where one gate was open
for its reception; to turn from the road was prohibited
under penalty of death. The priests took one-tenth by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
measure for the god Sabin, sales not being allowed until
their claim was satisfied. The olibanum could be exported
only through the territory of the Gebanites, whose
King also levied tribute.</p>

<p>Pliny further states that the Arabs did not steal one
from another, but for fear of loss those employed in the
stores of Alexandria were forced to go naked with the
exception of a clout which was sealed. A mask and a
thick net were thrown over the head.</p>

<p>To us the practice of anointing the entire body, customary
among the ancients, appears very singular. Old
Egyptian sculptures represent the guests being anointed
at the meal. Among the Jews we find a holy oil with
which Aaron and his sons were anointed to consecrate
them to the priesthood, Moses prescribing for this holy
anointing oil, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and oil from
the olive tree. Other persons were prohibited from
imitating or using this holy oil. The anointing of
kings was introduced later on. Though it was prohibited
to imitate and use the holy oil, this prohibition
did not refer to anointing with oil in general.</p>

<p>That the Greeks also set a high value upon anointing
with oil is plainly seen from Homer. When Telemachus
visited Nestor, Polycaste, Nestor's youngest
daughter, bathed him and anointed him with oil, and
when he was the guest of Menelaus, the maids of the
latter performed the same service for him, while for
Ulysses returning as a beggar, the aged Euryclea prepared
a foot-bath and anointed him.</p>

<p>By the addition of fragrant substances to the oil,
the sweet-scented ointment, <i>myron</i>, originated. While
the anointing with simple oil evidently served as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a hygienic measure after the bath, and especially for
men in the gymnasium, and before a combat, with the
Greeks, ointments were an article of luxury. In
Socrates' time the use of sweet-scented ointments had
reached such an extent, that Xenophon caused him to
speak against it, but, as is the case with all such lectures
against fashion, without the slightest success. In
Athens the luxury was carried so far that the bacchanalians
anointed each part of their body with a special
ointment. The oil extracted from the palm was
thought best adapted to the cheeks and the breasts; the
arms were refreshed with balsam-mint; sweet marjoram
supplied an oil for the hair and eyebrows; and wild
thyme for the knee and neck. Although to us it would
be repugnant to have the entire body anointed, in
Athens it was considered beautiful to be glossy with
ointments. It is said of Demetrius Phalereus, that in
order to appear more captivating, he dyed his hair
yellow, and anointed the face and the rest of his body.</p>

<p>From the Asiatics and Greeks the Romans also
learned the use of ointments. Pliny cannot say at
what time they were introduced in Rome, but states
that after the conquest of Asia and the defeat of the
King, Antiochus, in the year 565, after the building of
Rome, the censors issued an edict prohibiting the sale of
foreign ointments. However, this edict was of no use,
and the practice spread more and more, Pliny speaking
very bitterly about it. Regarding this extravagance in
ointments, Plutarch says: "Frankincense, cinnamon,
spikenard, and Arabian calamus are mixed together
with the most careful art and sold for large sums. It
is an effeminate pleasure and has spoiled not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
women but also the men, who will not sleep even with
their own wives if they do not smell of ointments and
powders." Plutarch further mentions an incident which
must have created a sensation even in luxurious Rome,
as otherwise it would scarcely have been chronicled for
the benefit of posterity. Nero one day anointed himself
with costly ointments and scattered some of them
over Otho. The next day Otho gave Nero a banquet,
and laid in all directions gold and silver tubes, which
poured forth expensive ointments like water, thoroughly
saturating the guests.</p>

<p>Directions for preparing ointments are contained in
Theophrastus's work "On Perfumes," in Dioscorides's
"Medica materia," and Pliny's "Historia naturalis."
Dioscorides's receipts are the fullest. According to Pliny,
a distinction was made between the juice and the body,
the latter consisting of the fat oils and the former of the
sweet-scented substances. In preparing the ointments,
the oil together with the perfuming substances were
heated in the water-bath. For instance, rose ointment
was, according to Dioscorides, prepared by mixing
5&frac12; lbs. of bruised <i>Andropogon Schœnanthus</i> with a little
water, then adding 20&frac12; lbs. of oil and heating. After
heating the oil was filtered off, and the petals of one
thousand roses were thrown into the oil, the hands with
which the rose leaves were pressed into the oil being
previously coated with honey. When the whole had
stood for one night, the oil was strained off and when
all impurities had settled, it was brought into another
vessel and fresh rose leaves introduced, the operation
being several times repeated. However, according to
the opinion of the ancient ointment makers, no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
odor was absorbed by the oil after the seventh introduction
of rose leaves. To fix the odor, resins or gums
were added to the ointments.</p>

<p>A process of distilling volatile oils was also known,
the odoriferous matter being caught by spreading wool
over the heated perfume-substances. The wool was
afterwards subjected to pressure. This process, of
course, involved great loss and was available only for
substances containing much volatile oil.</p>

<p>Dioscorides also gives directions for making animal fats
suitable for the reception of perfumes. Beef-tallow, deer-fat,
or the marrow of animals was freed from all membranes,
melted together with a little salt in an entirely
new vessel, and then poured into clean water, where it
was washed by rubbing with the hands, the water being
frequently renewed. Then it was boiled with equal
parts of sweet-scented wine, and after taking it from
the fire it was allowed to stand over night. The next
day the cold fat was again boiled in a new vessel, with
sweet-scented wine, this operation being repeated until
the fat had lost every trace of disagreeable odor, when
it was brought in contact with the perfumes.</p>

<p>The consumption of perfume-substances by the ancient
Romans must have been enormous. The trade of
the ointment makers (<i lang="la">ungentarii</i>) was so extensive that
the large street <i>Seplasia</i> in old Capua was entirely
taken up by it, and the business must have paid well
since the prices realized were very high. However, in
ancient times the business cannot have been very agreeable,
at least not in Greece, as shown by a passage in
Plutarch's Life of Pericles: "We take pleasure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
ointments and purple, but consider the dyers and ointment
makers bondsmen and mechanics."</p>

<p>Red and white paints, in the form of powder as well
as of paste, were extensively used by the Roman ladies.
Chalk and white lead served for white paint, and
minium and carmine for red. Lovers preferred white
paints, a pale color being more becoming to them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Palleat omnis amans; hic est</div>
<div class="verse indent2">color aptus amanti."&mdash;(<cite>Ovid.</cite>)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For black paints for the eyebrows roasted ant eggs
or soot were used.</p>

<p>The Roman ladies paid as much attention to their
natural, and also false, hair as the fair ones of to-day.
They curled their hair with heated iron instruments,
and perfumed them with fragrant oil. If from age,
sorrow, or other reasons, the hair was no longer black,
it was dyed, and it seems that a considerable number of
hair-dyes were known in Rome, amongst them some
which are still employed to-day, such as green nutshells
and acetate of lead.</p>

<p>After the Romans had seen the blonde German
maidens, blonde and red hair became the fashion. To
dye the hair blonde sharp alkaline soaps were chiefly
used. However, this or some other hair-dye seems to
have been very injurious, as it caused the hair to come
out. The satirists ridiculed this as well as the wigs,
which were worn by men and women to hide baldness,
or on account of the color which could not be attained
by dyes.</p>

<p>Depilatories were also known to the Romans, the
agents employed being called <i lang="la">psilothrum</i> and <i lang="la">dropax</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
They were of vegetable origin, but it is not exactly
known from which plants they were derived.</p>

<p>For cleaning the teeth the Roman ladies used a dentifrice
which does not seem very inviting to us. It consisted
of a urine imported from Spain (<i lang="la">dens hiberna
defricatus urina</i>). To perfume the breath or to hide its
bad odor, mouth-washes, perfumed with saffron, roses,
etc., were used, or myrrh, mastic from Chios or perfumed
pastilles were chewed.</p>

<p>We know but little regarding the use of perfumeries
and cosmetics in the Middle Ages. In the wars during
the migrations of the nations, but little thought was
very likely given to them, but as soon as the nations
became again settled and made sufficient progress in
culture, the taste for perfumes and other pleasures of
life no doubt returned. Our knowledge in this respect
is limited to what is contained in the works of physicians
of the first centuries. Later on we find receipts
for cosmetics in the writings of Arabian physicians,
such as Rhazes (end of the 9th to the commencement of
the 10th century), Avicenna (end of the 10th to the
commencement of the 11th century), and Mesuë (11th
century). To the 11th century also belong the works
of the celebrated Trotula, "<i lang="la">De mulierum passionibus</i>,"
"<i lang="la">Practica Trotulae mulieris Salernitanae de curis mulierum</i>,"
and "<i lang="la">Trotula in utilitatem mulierum</i>," all of which
contain receipts for cosmetics. In the 14th century the
most celebrated surgeon of the Middle Ages, Guy de
Chanlios, did not consider it beneath his dignity to devote
a section of his "Grande Chirurgie" to cosmetics.
However, it was only in the 16th century that perfumes
and cosmetics came again into prominent notice in Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
which at that time was the country of luxury and art.
Giovanni Marinello,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a physician, in 1562 wrote a
work on "Cosmetics for Ladies," which he dedicated
to the ladies Victoria and Isabella Palavicini. In the
preface the author expresses the opinion that it is only
right and pleasing to God to place the gifts bestowed by
him in a proper light and to heighten them. He then
proceeds to give perfumes for various purposes, aromatic
baths to keep the skin young and fresh, means for increasing
the stoutness of the entire body and of separate
limbs, and others for reducing them. He further recommends
certain remedies for making large eyes small,
and small ones large. The chapter on the hair is very
fully treated. To prevent the hair from coming out,
rubbing with oil, and then washing with sorrel and
myrobalan is recommended. For promoting the growth
of the hair, the use of dried frogs, lizards, etc., rubbed
to a powder, is prescribed. Means for making the hair
long and soft and curly are also given, and others
recommended for eyebrows and eyelashes. As depilatories
lime and orpiment are prescribed. Paints are also
classed among general cosmetics. Their use became at
this time more and more fashionable, and not only the
face, but also the breast and neck were painted.</p>

<p>Catherine of Medici and Margaret of Valois introduced
these arts of the toilet into France. That country
soon became the leader in this respect, and for many
years the greatest luxury in perfumes and cosmetics
prevailed there. The golden age for these articles lasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
from the commencement of the seventeenth to the middle
of the eighteenth century, during which time the
<i lang="fr">mouche</i> or beauty patch also flourished. "There were at
that time hundreds of pastes, essences, cosmetics, a white
balsam, a water to make the face red, another to make a
coarse complexion delicate, one to preserve the fine complexion
of lean persons and again one to make the face
like that of a twenty-year old girl, an <i lang="fr">Eau pour nourir
et laver les teints corrodés</i> and <i lang="fr">Eau de chair admirable
pour teints jaunes et bilieux</i>, <i>etc.</i> Then there were <i lang="fr">Mouchoirs
de Venus</i>, further bands impregnated with wax
to cleanse and smooth the forehead; gold leaf was even
heated in a lemon over a fire in order to obtain a means
which should impart to the face a supernatural brightness.
For the hair, teeth and nails there were innumerable
receipts, ointments, etc. However, of special
importance were the paints, chemical white, blue for the
veins, but, chief of all, the red or rouge, mineral, vegetable,
or cochineal. The application of rouge was at
that time no small affair, it was not only to be rouged,
but the rouge had also to express something&mdash;<i lang="fr">Le grand
point est d'avoir un rouge qui dise quelque chose</i>. The
rouge had to characterize its wearer; a lady of rank did
not wear the rouge like a lady of the court, and the rouge
of the wife of the bourgeois was not like either of them
nor like that of the courtesan. At court a more intense
rouge was worn, the intensity of which was still increased
on the day of presentation, it being then <i lang="fr">Rouge
d'Espagne</i> and <i lang="fr">Rouge de Portugal en tasse</i>. It may
seem incredible, but for eight days a violet paint was
used and then for a change <i lang="fr">Rouge de Serkis</i>. Ladies,
when retiring for the night applied a light rouge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
(<i lang="fr">un demi rouge</i>), and even small girls wore rouge, such being
the decree of fashion. The ladies dyed their eyebrows
and eyelashes, and powdered their hair, both natural
and false, for, about 1750, they commenced wearing
wigs and chignons. Powdering was done partially for
the purpose of dying the hair after dressing, and partially
for decoration; white, gray, red and fiery red
powders were in vogue."</p>

<p>To that time fashion also ordained an ever-varying
routine in the employment of perfumes; so that the
royal apartments were one day fragrant with the scent of
the tuberose and the next with that of amber and cloves;
and so on consecutively, each succeeding day bringing a
change of the reigning odor. In that luxurious age the
personal use of perfumes was not confined to the fair
sex, but the effeminate gallants of the day gloried in
perfuming themselves with the favorite scents of their
mistresses or of prominent belles; so that the allegiance
was recognized, not as in more chivalrous times by the
knight wearing the colors of the fair one who had enslaved
him, but by his smelling of the particular odor
which she had consecrated to herself.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus, in 1190, granted a charter to the
French perfumers, who had formed a guild. This
charter was, in 1357, confirmed by John, and in 1582
by Henry III., and remained in force until 1636. The
importance of the craft in France is shown by the fact
that under Colbert the perfumers or "<i lang="fr">parfumeurs-gantiers</i>,"
as they were called, were granted patents which
were registered in Parliament. In the seventeenth century
Montpellier was the chief seat of the French perfumery
industry; to-day it is Paris, and over fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
millions of francs' worth of perfumery are annually sold
there. The <i lang="fr">parfumeurs-gantiers</i> had the privilege of
selling gloves of all possible kinds of material, as well
as the leather required for them; they had the further
privilege of perfuming gloves and selling all kinds of
perfumes. Perfumed leather for gloves, purses, etc.,
was at that time imported from Spain. This leather
was very expensive and fashionable, but on account
of its penetrating odor its use for gloves was finally
abandoned.</p>

<p>In England perfumes were not in general use before
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when they soon became
fashionable. Elizabeth had an especially finely developed
sense of smell and nothing was more repugnant to
her than a disagreeable odor. She had a cloak of perfumed
Spanish leather, and even her shoes were perfumed.
Perfumed gloves were also fashionable. The
city soon imitated the practices of the court, and that an
extravagant use was made of perfumeries and cosmetics is
plainly seen from the works of the authors of that time,
as well as from an act of Parliament passed in 1770.
By the latter it is ordained that any woman, no matter
of what age or rank, be she maid or widow, who deceives
a man and inveigles him into matrimony by the
use of perfumeries, false hair, <i lang="fr">Crépons d'Espagne</i> (a
paint), corsets, hooped petticoats, shoes with high heels,
and false hips, shall suffer the penalty of the law for
procuring, and the marriage shall be null and void.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2></div>

<p class="subh">THE PERFUME-MATERIALS FOR THE MANUFACTURE
OF PERFUMERY.</p>


<p>Most of the perfume-materials employed by the perfumer
are derived from the vegetable kingdom; a few
are of animal origin, whilst some are artificially prepared.</p>

<p>Of animal substances only four are used, namely:
<i>musk</i>, <i>castor</i> or <i>castoreum</i>, <i>civet</i>, and <i>ambergris</i>; the
separation of their characteristic odoriferous substances
has, however, not yet been accomplished. The odor of
plants is generally due to volatile substances called
<i>volatile</i> or <i>essential oils</i>. Their occurrence is not limited
to special parts, they being found in the flower, seed,
wood, bast, bark, leaves, and root. However, in every
plant the oil occurs chiefly in certain organs, and it
even happens that the oil differs with the part of the
plant whence it is derived. The odors exist already
formed in the living plant, or else are generated, as in
the instance of bitter almonds, by some reaction between
the elements which takes place during fermentation
or distillation.</p>

<p>From the strength of the odor of a plant no conclusion
can be drawn as to the quantity of volatile oil
present. If this were the case, the hyacinth, for instance,
would contain more oil than the coniferae, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
in fact it contains so little that it can be separated only
with the greatest difficulty. The odor does not depend
on the quantity, but on the quality of the oil; a plant
may diffuse but little odor and still contain much volatile
oil. Of the various families of plants, the <i>labiatae</i>,
<i>umbelliferae</i>, and <i>coniferae</i> are richest in volatile oils.</p>

<p>In every climate plants diffuse odor, those growing in
tropical latitudes being more prolific in this respect than
the plants of colder regions, which, however, yield the
most delicate perfume. Although the East Indies,
Ceylon, Peru, and Mexico afford some of the choicest
perfumes, Central Europe is the actual flower garden
of the perfumer, Grasse, Cannes, and Nice being the
principal places for the production of perfume-materials.
Thanks to the geographical position of these places, the
cultivator, within a comparatively narrow space, has at
his disposal various climates suitable for the most perfect
development of the plants. The <i>Acacia Farnesiana</i>
grows on the seashore, without having to fear frost,
which in one night might destroy the entire crop, while
at the foot of the Alps, on Mount Esteral, the violet
diffuses a much sweeter odor than in the hotter regions,
where the olive and the tuberose reach perfect bloom.
England asserts its superiority in oils of lavender and
peppermint. The volatile oils obtained from plants
cultivated in Mitcham and Hitchin command a considerably
higher price than those from other localities,
this preference being justified only by the delicacy of
their perfume. Cannes is best suited for roses, acacias,
jasmine, and neroli, while in Nimes, thyme, rosemary,
and lavender are chiefly cultivated. Nice is celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
for its violets, while Sicily furnishes the lemon and
orange, and Italy the iris and bergamotte.</p>

<p>The odors exhaled by our own domestic plants
have been but little studied, but the southern as well
as many northern districts of the United States are
well adapted for the cultivation of quite a number of
species of plants which might be made to yield highly
valuable articles of commerce. Among the plants which
might furnish oils for the perfumer's use are, for instance,
the wall flower, the Lilly, lilac and mignonette.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Volatile Oils.</span>&mdash;The volatile oils are either fluid
(actual volatile oils) or solid (varieties of camphor) or
solutions of solid combinations in fluid. The latter, on
exposure to low temperatures, separate into two portions,
one solid, called <i>stearoptene</i>, and the other liquid, called
<i>elæoptene</i>. The boiling point of the volatile oils is considerably
higher than that of water, but when heated
with water they pass over with the vapors. Upon
paper, fluid volatile oils produce grease spots, which
differ, however, from those caused by fat oils in that
they gradually disappear at an ordinary temperature,
and rapidly by gentle heating. Most volatile oils are
insoluble, or only with difficulty and sparingly soluble,
in water, but they impart to the latter their odor and
taste. They are readily soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform,
bisulphide of carbon and petroleum-ether, and
miscible in every proportion with fats and fat oils. By
their solubility in alcohol they differ from most fat oils.
When freshly prepared many volatile oils are colorless,
but soon turn yellow; some, however, show a distinct
color even when fresh. They ignite with greater ease
than fat oils and burn with a fierce smoky flame deposit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ing
a large amount of carbon. They exhibit a great
tendency to absorb oxygen from the air and to gum, the
influence of light promoting the process. In specific
gravity they range from about 0.75 to 1.17, most of them
being specifically lighter than water. Most bodies,
under otherwise equal conditions, show always exactly
the same specific gravity, the variations being so slight
that they may be justly ascribed to errors of observation.
However, one and the same volatile oil frequently shows
such variations in specific gravity, that we are forced to
ascribe this phenomenon to alterations in the constitution
of the oil itself. For the exact determination of the
specific gravity of a volatile oil, it should, therefore, be
subjected to examination immediately after its preparation
from the plant or vegetable substance, which should
be as fresh as possible. The influence of light upon
volatile oils is best shown by the following interesting
experiment: If certain volatile oils are distilled in a
vacuum or over burnt lime in a current of carbonic acid,
it is no longer possible to distinguish, for instance, oil of
lemon from oil of turpentine; however, by again exposing
the oils to the air, they reacquire their characteristic
odor.</p>

<p>According to their elementary composition the volatile
oils may be divided into three principal divisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Volatile oils free from oxygen, terpene (camphene),
or hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>2. Oxygenated volatile oils.</p>

<p>3. Volatile oils containing sulphur.</p>

<p>On account of the facility with which most of the
volatile oils absorb oxygen, oils originally free from
oxygen are frequently a mixture of hydrocarbons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
combinations containing oxygen. The volatile oils
varying so much in their physical as well as their
chemical properties, a suitable classification of them has
thus far been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Most of the volatile oils contain a liquid hydrocarbon,
<i>terpene</i>, which is characterized neither by special
taste nor odor, nor is the peculiarity of a volatile oil dependent
on it. In the direct distillation of a volatile
oil, for instance, lemon oil, this hydrocarbon (citrene),
passes first over and can, therefore, be readily separated
from the constituents on which depend the peculiarity of
lemon oil, and which distil over at a higher temperature.
The specific character of an oil is generally due
to the portion of the oil containing oxygen. Hence,
manufacturers have endeavored to free several of the
volatile oils, used for perfumery and the preparation of
food, from the worthless terpene and at the same time
to obtain them in a concentrated form. Carvol is, for
instance, caraway oil freed from carvene (terpene).
These concentrated oils are not only purer and more
agreeable in odor and taste and more readily soluble in
dilute alcohol, but, being more concentrated, an equal
volume of them goes much further than ordinary volatile
oil. In the price lists these oils are designated as
<i>extra strong</i>, <i>patented</i>, <i>concentrated</i>, <i>highly concentrated
oils</i> or <i>essences</i>.</p>

<p>All the terpenes occurring in the various oils are
combinations having the formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>, or polymeric
with it, C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>24</sub>, C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>32</sub>, etc. These terpenes exhibiting
certain deviations in regard to their properties, odor,
specific gravity, and boiling points, nearly as many terpenes
as there are volatile oils have been distinguished.
It is, however, very likely that these deviations may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
traced back to fortuitous circumstances, for example, to
the admixture of foreign substances occurring together
with the terpenes, and that, by a more accurate examination,
the number of terpenes entitled to be considered
pure chemical combinations will be considerably reduced.
By Wallach's labors, the identity of several terpenes
formerly considered distinct, has already been established,
whilst many others have been found to possess
properties in common.</p>

<p>According to the nature and quantity of the odoriferous
substances contained in the plants, various methods,
namely, <i>expression</i>, <i>distillation</i>, <i>extraction</i>, <i>maceration</i>,
and <i>absorption</i>, are employed for the purpose of obtaining
them.</p>

<p><i>Expression.</i>&mdash;This is only practicable when the substances
are especially rich in oil and of sufficient softness,
as in the case with the peel of the orange, citron, lemon,
etc. In such instances the material is simply placed
in a linen cloth and subjected to a strong pressure until
it ceases to yield oil. The press may be of any size
according to the quantity to be expressed. For small
quantities it generally consists of an iron vessel, having
a small opening at the bottom so that the oil may flow
out. The material is placed upon a perforated bottom
inside of the vessel and covered with a well-fitting iron
plate, that can be pressed down by means of a screw.
Though the material is fairly exhausted by such a press,
for large operations it is advisable to make use of a
hydraulic press, which is constructed and managed in
exactly the same manner as those used for the expression
of fixed oils.</p>

<p>By expression a turbid milky fluid is obtained, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
consists of the volatile oil and aqueous substances. The
latter are a solution of various extractive substances and
salts in water. This fluid, as it runs from the press, is
received in tall, narrow, glass vessels and brought into a
cool place for clarification. This frequently requires
several days, three distinct layers being generally distinguished.
On the bottom is a mucous layer consisting
of cell substances carried along by the liquid bodies.
Over this is a clear fluid consisting of a solution of extractive
substances, vegetable albumen, and salts, and
upon this floats the volatile oil, being specifically the
lightest body, which, by its greater refractive power, can
be clearly distinguished from the aqueous fluid.</p>

<p>The oil is separated by bringing all that has been
expressed into a bottle provided near the bottom with a
lateral neck closed by a cock. After separating the oil
from the aqueous fluid, the latter is allowed to escape
by opening the cock.</p>

<p>The oil obtained in this manner is still impure, and
requires further treatment to remove small vegetable
fibres, invisible to the naked eye, which float in them,
and cause them to be somewhat opaque and slightly
opalescent. By their subsequent decomposition they
would also give the oil a disagreeable odor.</p>

<p>There are two methods of obtaining the oil entirely
clear, viz., filtration and distillation. Filtration is the
cheaper process, but requires special precautions to exclude
the air as much as possible to prevent the oil from
undergoing injurious changes. By arranging the filtering
apparatus so that the oil always comes in contact with
only the same quantity of air, the injurious action of
the oxygen is reduced to a minimum. It is self-evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>dent
that the apparatus should not be placed in the
sun, but in a semi-dark, cool place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 1.</div>
<img src="images/fig_1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p>A filter of simple construction, and performing excellent
service, is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a large
glass bottle, <i>F</i>, hermetically closed by a doubly-perforated
cork. The neck of the glass funnel <i>T</i>, the
upper rim of which is ground smooth, is placed in one
of the holes, and a glass tube, <i>r</i>, bent at a right angle,
is fitted into the second hole. A thick wooden lid, with
a rubber ring on the lower side, is placed upon the
funnel, thus closing it air-tight. In the centre of the
lid is fitted a glass tube, <i>r´</i>, also bent at a right angle,
which is connected with the tube <i>r</i>, by a rubber hose, <i>k</i>.
After the funnel has been provided with filtering paper
and the oil to be filtered, the lid is placed upon it, and
must not be removed, except for the purpose of pouring
more oil into the funnel. The air in the bottle <i>F</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
displaced by the oil dropping into it, and escapes
through <i>r</i>, <i>k</i> and <i>r´</i> into the funnel, and thus only the
air in the bottle and funnel can act upon the oil.</p>

<p>The other method for the complete purification of
expressed oil is by rectification or distillation with
water. For this purpose the oil, together with a little
water, is brought into one of the stills described later
on, and the oil distilled over. It is sometimes difficult
to obtain the last portion of the oil, especially with a
still heated by direct fire, and it is therefore preferable
to combine it with a fresh quantity of the same oil to
be distilled.</p>

<p><i>Distillation.</i>&mdash;There are at present two methods in
use. The one is founded upon the direct action of
the heat, the other upon the use of steam. The
first was formerly in general practice, and is still
largely employed in France and England, and to a
limited extent in this country. It is, however, very
deficient in many respects. As the stills must necessarily
be of small capacity, only small quantities can be
distilled at one time, and the oils very rarely possess
the peculiar odor due to them, and sometimes the odor
is even altered. In mixing too little water with the
materials to be extracted, there is danger that empyreumatic
oils will be formed; a large quantity of water, on
the other hand, is of disadvantage, in so far as in case
the perfume-materials contain little oil, only a perfumed
water, but no oil, will be obtained. In order to avoid
these inconveniences, or, at least, to do away with some
of them, another plan was devised. The materials to
be distilled were spread upon sieves, which were suspended
in the upper part of a still, so that they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
be penetrated from below. It is true no scorching is
possible in this case, as was in the other process when
the heating was continued after all the water had evaporated,
and the oil retains its proper color, but by this
method only small quantities can be extracted at a time.
The still generally used for distillation with direct heat
resembles so much an ordinary whiskey still as to need
no further description here.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_2"></a>Fig. 2.</div>
<img src="images/fig_2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For the accurate determination of the percentage of
volatile oil a vegetable substance will yield, or to obtain
the oil from very costly raw materials, the small glass
apparatus, Fig. 2, is used. The flask <i>A</i>, with a capacity
of up to 5 or 6 quarts, serves for a still. In the
tube <i>t</i>, shaped like the neck of a bottle, is inserted by
means of a cork, a funnel tube, <i>l</i>, reaching to the bottom
of the flask. The neck of the flask passes into the
cooling pipe, which lies in a so-called Liebig cooler.
This consists of a wide-glass tube, <i>C</i>, into the lower end
of which, at <i>h</i>, flows cold water from the reservoir <i>D</i>,
displacing the heated water at <i>g</i>. The lower end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
cooling pipe is connected with the neck-shaped tube <i>v</i>,
under which stands the vessel for the reception of the
distillate. To prevent the cracking of the flask, which
might readily happen with the use of direct heat, it is
placed in a vessel filled with sand or water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 3.</div>
<img src="images/fig_3.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A very good small apparatus for the distillation of
volatile oil is shown in Fig. 3. It is known as a siphon
still. It consists of a double-walled boiler, surmounted
by a still-head, which is provided with a mechanism for
keeping the contents of the boiler in motion. This
stirring apparatus consists of a perpendicular shaft, bearing
a frame work of iron, curved so as to correspond to
the interior shape of the still, and on the outside carrying
a chain which scrapes over the inner surface of the still
while the stirrer is being turned. This may be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
either by hand or by steam. The still having been
charged with the material to be extracted, is filled up
with water to within a few inches of the top of the body
of the still, and the latter is heated by admitting steam.
The vapors arising are conducted to a cooler situated at
a higher level than the still itself, and the condensed
liquid is collected in a receiver, where the oil and water
separate. This receiver is provided with two faucets,
one near the top and the other near the bottom. If the
oil passing over is heavier than water, the excess of the
latter is removed by the upper faucet; if the oil swims
on the water, the lower faucet is regulated so as to
allow the water to escape in about the same ratio as it
enters the receiver. In either case the condensed water
is made to run back into the still, and the loss of oil
is, therefore, greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Sometimes a single-walled still is used, and distillation
carried on with direct steam. This method is,
however, not suitable where the presence of water is
necessary, for instance, in the production of oil of bitter
almonds.</p>

<p>A simple way of converting an ordinary still into
use with steam is shown in Fig. 4. For the helmet of
the still <i>A</i> is substituted a cylindrical vessel, <i>B</i>, with
an opening in the bottom. The materials to be distilled
are brought into <i>B</i>, and rest upon a wire bottom
to prevent particles from falling into <i>A</i>. From the
upper portion of <i>B</i> a pipe, <i>R</i>, leads to the condenser.
As may be seen from the illustration, the still <i>A</i> serves
only for the generation of steam. The latter, in passing
through <i>B</i>, heats the contents and absorbs the liberated
oil, the combined vapors passing into the condenser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 4.</div>
<img src="images/fig_4.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This simple modification of the ordinary still affords
some advantage, the principal being the avoidance of
the condensation of a large quantity of water. This in
itself would not amount to much, but it has to be taken
into consideration that, though volatile oils are only
very sparingly soluble in water, they are nevertheless
soluble in it to such a degree as to impart to it their
characteristic odor and taste. Such aromatized water can
be utilized in the manufacture of liqueurs and perfumery,
but to the manufacturer who restricts himself to
the production of volatile oils alone, this represents a
loss, and it is therefore necessary for him to condense as
little water as possible. And this object can only be
attained by the use of direct steam.</p>

<p>A simple apparatus for the purpose is shown in Fig.
5. The still <i>b</i>, provided with a helmet, rests free upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a suitable support. To prevent cooling, it is surrounded
with a wooden jacket, <i>M</i>. The material to be extracted
rests upon a perforated bottom, beneath which enters the
pipe <i>HD</i>, which conducts the steam from the boiler.
For the more uniform distribution of the steam, it is
recommended to let this pipe end in a perforated coil.
The water condensed in the apparatus itself is discharged
through the short pipe <i>H</i>, placed in the lowest
part of the still.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 5.</div>
<img src="images/fig_5.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>An improved apparatus for distilling dry substances
by steam has been patented in Germany by Messrs.
Schimmel &amp; Co., of Leipzic. The tall conical column
at the left (Fig. 6) is the still. About eight inches from
the bottom is a perforated diaphragm or false bottom,
upon which the material to be distilled is placed by introducing
it through the still-head. A perforated coil
below the diaphragm projects steam upwards through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the mass, which is occasionally agitated from without
by means of a horizontal stirring apparatus indicated
by the two crosses. Any condensed water which may
run back is converted into steam by the heating coil
at the bottom. Meanwhile, the mass itself is heated
by a long coil lining the body of the still and carrying
steam at a high pressure. Whatever of volatile oil
is carried forward by the steam passes through the still-head
into the cooler on the right, where both oil and
steam are condensed, and from where they flow through
a small funnel tube into three successive receivers,
which are arranged like Florentine flasks, and which
retain the volatile oil that has separated. From the
last receiver the water, which is still impregnated with
oil, enters another reservoir, shown in the illustration
only by dots, and from there it flows into a small
globular still situated underneath; in which, by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of steam, nearly all the oil still retained is again volatilized
with the steam of the water and both again conducted
to the cooler.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 6.</div>
<img src="images/fig_6.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Attempts have been made to effect the distillation of
volatile oils without the use of steam by means of hot air,
but comparative experiments have shown that less oil
is obtained. With the use of steam, the vegetable
substances swell up by the absorption of water, and thus
afford a free passage to the oil, liberated from the sacs
containing it. With the use of hot air, on the other
hand, the surface of the plant is completely dried and
shrivels to a hard solid mass, which offers considerable
resistance to the process of distillation.</p>

<p>This injurious effect of hot air can be somewhat
overcome by thoroughly moistening the plants to be distilled,
and allowing the hot air, before entering the still,
to pass through a pipe filled with sponges constantly
kept wet. But this process offers no advantages over
that by steam. The apparatus required is far more
complicated; and, besides, a ventilator has to be provided
for forcing the hot air through the apparatus.</p>

<p><i>Separation of the oil and water.</i>&mdash;As previously
mentioned the specific gravity of most volatile oils is
less than that of water. This behavior is utilized for
the separation of the oil and water, by means of a so-called
Florentine flask (Fig. 7). It consists of a glass
flask provided near the bottom with a pipe, <i>a</i>, rising vertically
to near the neck <i>c</i> of the flask where it is bent
downwards as shown in the illustration. The mixed
liquid of water and oil drips from the cooling pipe into
the flask, and the water <i>w</i>, being specifically heavier,
separates from the oil floating on the top, and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
ascends in the pipe <i>a</i>, finally flowing over at <i>d</i>. Oils
specifically heavier than water are caught in receivers
provided with a discharge-pipe near the mouth of the
flask as shown in Fig. 8.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_7-8.jpg" alt="Fig. 7 and 8" />
</div>

<p>The oil delivered from the receivers is, however, still
mixed with some water, dirt, etc., and for their separation
is allowed to stand quietly for some time. The
final separation is effected either by simply pouring off
the oil, especially if larger quantities have to be handled,
or with the assistance of a separator-funnel (Fig. 9). This
consists of the glass-funnel <i>T</i> secured to the stand <i>G</i>,
and provided with a close-fitting lid, <i>P</i>. The fluid is
poured into the funnel, the lid placed in position, and the
whole allowed to rest until the water <i>W</i> is completely
separated from the oil <i>O</i>. The oil is then separated
from the last drops of water by carefully opening the
faucet <i>H</i>.</p>

<p>Most volatile oils are obtained by distillation, but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
method is not practicable for separating the odoriferous
principle of many of the most sweet-scented and delicate
flowers, partially because the flowers contain too little
oil, and partially because the oil would lose in quality
if obtained by distillation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 9.</div>

</div>

<p><i>Extraction.</i>&mdash;For obtaining the volatile oils by extraction
various solvents such as ether, bisulphide of
carbon, etc., may be employed. Carefully rectified
petroleum-ether is very suitable for the purpose. It
completely evaporates at about 122° F., and when sufficiently
purified does not possess a disagreeable odor.
The process of extraction is briefly as follows: The
material to be extracted is treated in a digester with
petroleum-ether or one of the above-named solvents.
The solution is then drawn off and the solvent evapo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>rated
in a still. The recondensed solvent flows immediately
back into the digester and further extracts the
material contained therein. The operation is repeated
until nothing soluble remains. In practice some difficulties
are, however, connected with this process since,
besides the volatile oils, resins, and coloring and extractive
substances are dissolved, which have to be removed,
as well as the last traces of the solvent, as otherwise
the oil would acquire a foreign odor. Further
the solvents mentioned are very volatile and inflammable,
requiring the greatest precautions as regards
fire. For these reasons the extraction process is not
suitable for many purposes, and though at first great
hopes were entertained in regard to it, its use is
limited to substances with a large content of volatile
oil.</p>

<div class="figright">
<div class="caption">Fig. 10.</div>
<img src="images/fig_10.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For extraction on a small scale, the apparatus, Fig. 10,
is a very suitable one. It is especially adapted for
manufacturers of perfumery, who
wish to extract fresh flowers. It
consists of a cylindrical vessel, <i>C</i>,
of tin plate, provided on the bottom
with the stop-cock <i>a</i> and the
pipe <i>b</i>. The lid <i>D</i> fits into a
gutter, <i>R</i>, running around the
edge of <i>C</i>, and is hermetically
closed by water in <i>R</i>. The cylinder
is filled with the vegetable
substance to be extracted, and
sufficient petroleum-ether or bisulphide of carbon to
cover it, poured in. The lid is then adjusted, the gutter
<i>R</i> filled with water and the apparatus allowed to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
quietly for forty minutes. To remove the fluid from
the cylinder, the faucet <i>o</i> in the lid is first opened, and
then the stop-cock <i>a</i>; the fluid escapes at <i>b</i>, and is
caught in a well-closed vessel. The operation may be
repeated once or twice, or the vegetable substance is
pressed out by means of a wooden plate, and the apparatus
filled anew. The faucet <i>h</i> serves for emptying
the gutter <i>R</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<div class="caption">Fig. 11.</div>
<img src="images/fig_11.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Extraction being finished, the cock <i>o</i> is opened, and
then the cock <i>a</i>, and the fluid allowed to run into the
flask of the distilling apparatus (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>). For working
on a large scale, the flask is, however, too small, and is
suitably replaced by a bottle-shaped tin vessel, <i>F</i> (Fig.
11), the conical cover <i>D</i> of which is secured by means
of the rubber ring <i>R</i> and iron screw-clamps, <i>S</i>. A
bent glass tube fitted into the cover is connected with
the cooling-pipe of the apparatus shown in <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>. But
the oils prepared by extraction are not sufficiently purified
by mere rectification, as traces of the solvent adhere
tenaciously to them, which can only be removed by passing
a current of air through the oil. But contact with air
has an injurious effect upon the
delicacy of the odor. For expensive
oils a current of air
should therefore never be used,
but one of pure carbonic acid.
Fig. 12 shows a suitable apparatus
for the purpose. The
large bottle <i>A</i>, filled half full
with pieces of white marble, is
closed with a doubly-perforated
cork; through one of the holes
is inserted a funnel-tube, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
through the other a short tube bent at a right angle.
The latter is connected with another tube which reaches
to the bottom of the vessel <i>B</i>, in which is also inserted
a tube open in the bottom, and a short tube bent at a
right angle. Alongside <i>B</i> stands another vessel, <i>C</i>,
arranged in the same manner. The tube leading from
<i>C</i> is connected with a tin pipe, <i>D</i>, with a rose-like expansion
on its lower end. This pipe is inserted in the
glass balloon containing the volatile oil. Finally, a
pipe leads to the flask <i>F</i>, filled with water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 12.</div>
<img src="images/fig_12.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To put the apparatus in operation, strongly diluted
hydrochloric acid is poured through the funnel-tube
upon the pieces of marble in <i>A</i>, which causes the development
of a current of carbonic acid. But as the
latter carries along water and hydrochloric acid, it has
to be freed from them before coming in contact with
the volatile oil. The vessels <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> serve for the purpose.
<i>B</i> is half filled with water, while <i>C</i> contains
strong sulphuric acid. In <i>B</i> the hydrochloric acid carried
along with the current of carbonic acid is retained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
while the water is fixed on the sulphuric acid in <i>C</i>.
The current of carbonic acid passing out from <i>C</i> is perfectly
pure, and enters the volatile oil through the fine
perforations in the pipe <i>D</i>. It absorbs the traces of
solvent still adhering to the oil, and finally passes out
through the water in the bottle <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>Volatile oils obtained by extraction, and purified by
a current of carbonic acid, will keep for years without
undergoing alteration, if placed immediately in hermetically
closed vessels and stored in a dark place. Oils
purified by a current of air always become somewhat
thickly fluid by storing, and partially lose their fine
odor, which is due to the oxygen absorbed during the
process.</p>

<p>For the extraction of oil on a larger scale, the apparatus
shown in Fig. 13 is very suitable. It consists of
two principal parts, the actual extracting vessel <i>E</i>, and
the still <i>B</i>. The extracting vessel <i>E</i> sits in a vat containing
cold water, <i>W</i>, the arrangement being such that
the heated water can be removed and replaced by cold.
The still <i>B</i> sits in a boiler, <i>K</i>, filled with hot water.</p>

<p>The apparatus is charged as follows: The conical
head <i>C</i> of the extracting vessel <i>E</i> is unscrewed and its
connection at <i>H</i> with the pipe <i>R</i> loosened. The extracting
vessel is then charged with the vegetable substance,
the head <i>C</i> replaced, and the connection with
the pipe <i>R</i> restored. The cocks <i>H</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>H</i><sub>4</sub> are then
opened, and the required quantity of solvent is brought
into the still. Both cocks are then closed, and the cocks
<i>H</i> and <i>H</i><sub>1</sub> opened. The water in the boiler is then
heated until the contents of the still commence to boil.
The vapor of the solvent ascends through the pipe <i>R</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
on entering the extracting vessel <i>E</i> it is condensed, and
after falling as a spray upon the material to be extracted,
finally returns impregnated with volatile oil to the still
<i>B</i>. Here the solvent is revaporized, and passes again
through the material in the extracting vessel, while the
extracted oil remains in the still. During the boiling
of the solvent the extracting vessel must be suitably
cooled by the constant admission of cold water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 13.</div>
<img src="images/fig_13.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When extraction is finished, the cocks <i>H</i> and <i>H</i><sub>1</sub> are
closed, and the cock <i>H</i><sub>2</sub>, which is connected with a cooling
worm, is opened. The solvent is then evaporated,
and regained by condensation. The oil is discharged,
from the still through a pipe in the bottom provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>with the cock <i>H</i><sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The apparatus may also be so arranged that the still
<i>B</i> is connected with two extracting vessels which are
used alternately, while the contents of one are being extracted
the other is emptied and refilled.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 14.</div>
<img src="images/fig_14.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For working on a very large scale, Heyl's extracting
apparatus, shown in Fig. 14, is very suitable. It consists
of a battery of four or more cast iron or sheet iron
cylinders, <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>A</i><sub>4</sub>, communicating with each other and
surrounded by steam jackets. The extracting vessels
are so arranged that they can be emptied by tilting,
which is rather inconvenient, as all the pipes have to
be unscrewed. In each cylinder close above the bottom
is a perforated plate covered with fine wire-gauze, upon
which the material to be extracted is placed. The
cylinder is filled to the top, and, after placing a similar
plate upon it, the upper opening is closed by a lid suspended
to a crane. The cylinder, as well as the lid, is
provided with a broad flange, between which is placed
a hemp tissue firmly pressed together by 12 clamps to
serve for packing. After filling the cylinders with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
material to be extracted and arranging the packing, the
solvent (bisulphide of carbon) is conducted from a reservoir
through the principal pipe, <i>B</i>, to the extracting
vessels, and is introduced into <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> by opening the cock
<i>C</i><sub>2</sub>, which communicates with the pipe <i>B</i>. The bisulphide
of carbon passes through the bent pipe <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>, enters
through the cock <i>E</i><sub>2</sub>, below the false bottom of the
cylinder <i>A</i><sub>2</sub>, and, after penetrating the mass and filling
the cylinder, runs through the cock <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> of the bent pipe
<i>D</i><sub>2</sub>, and the cock <i>E</i><sub>3</sub> into the cylinder <i>A</i><sub>3</sub>, reaching the
fourth cylinder in the same manner through the cock
<i>C</i><sub>3</sub>, the pipe <i>D</i><sub>3</sub>, and the cock <i>E</i><sub>4</sub>. From the last cylinder
it passes as a thoroughly saturated oil solution into
a reservoir, in which a vacuum has been created to promote
the circulation of the fluid in the entire apparatus.
After a quantity of oil solution corresponding to the
contents of the cylinder <i>A</i><sub>4</sub> has arrived, the cock <i>G</i><sub>4</sub> is
closed and the cock <i>C</i><sub>4</sub> opened, whereby the cylinder
<i>A</i><sub>4</sub> is connected with <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> by the bent pipe <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> and the
cock <i>E</i><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>After the exhaustion of the contents of the cylinder
<i>A</i><sub>2</sub>, which is recognized by means of the glass tube <i>H</i><sub>2</sub>
placed on <i>D</i><sub>2</sub> by the fluid running off being colorless, the
cocks <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> are closed, and <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>3</sub> opened, whereby
the solvent runs into <i>A</i><sub>3</sub>, and from there to <i>A</i><sub>4</sub> and <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>;
<i>A</i><sub>2</sub> being omitted. To effect this omission, and at the
same time not to prevent the introduction of bisulphide
of carbon, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>, and <i>C</i><sub>4</sub>, are so-called two-way
cocks, which, when placed in one position, connect the
principal pipe <i>B</i> with the branch pipes <i>D</i>, but interrupt
a further flow through the principal pipe <i>B</i>; while in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the other position they close the pipes <i>D</i> and open the
principal pipe <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>The cylinder <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> is, however, still filled with the solvent
and material saturated with it. To remove the solvent,
the discharge cock <i>K</i><sub>2</sub> on the bottom of the cylinder
is opened, which communicates with the discharge
pipe <i>J</i>, through which the bisulphide of carbon is conducted
into a reservoir. The discharge is promoted by
opening the cock <i>M</i><sub>2</sub>, connected with the pipe <i>L</i>, and
the admittance of compressed air, which displaces the
liquid solvent. After the flow of the latter has ceased,
the steam cocks on the jacket <i>O</i><sub>2</sub> and the cylinder <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> are
opened under constant admission of air and simultaneous
introduction of steam through the pipe <i>N</i> into the upper
part of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The solvent (bisulphide of carbon) converted into
vapor by the heat, is conducted together with the
aqueous vapor, by the admission of air through the cock
<i>K</i><sub>2</sub>, the pipe <i>J</i>, and a cooling pipe placed between the
extracting vessels and the reservoir, and collected in a
reservoir to be re-used.</p>

<p>On account of the great volatility of bisulphide of
carbon, considerable loss would, however, be incurred
by the above-mentioned admission of air. To avoid
this, the reservoir serving for the reception of the condensed
bisulphide of carbon and aqueous vapor is closed,
and connected by a pipe with a long, narrow, horizontal
cylinder half filled with oil, and provided with a fan-shaft.
The vapors of bisulphide of carbon entering the
cylinder from the reservoir are absorbed, together with
the air by the oil, the surface of which is constantly agitated
by the fan-shaft, while the air, rendered entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
inodorous, passes out at the other end. The bisulphide
of carbon is finally separated from the oil by distillation
and again used.</p>

<p>After the cylinder <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> is sufficiently steamed, it is
emptied and again charged with material and connected
with the cylinder <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>; while the other cylinders undergo
the same manipulations described above.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 15.</div>
<img src="images/fig_15.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The saturated oil solution is subjected to distillation,
which is readily effected in Heyl's apparatus,
Fig. 15. The lower part of the still <i>A</i> of boiler
plate is surrounded by the steam-jacket <i>B</i>, into which
steam is admitted through <i>C</i> and the condensed water
discharged through <i>D</i>. The concentrated oil solution
runs from a reservoir, standing at a higher level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
through the pipe <i>E</i> into the still, the admission of a
sufficient quantity being indicated by the gauge <i>F</i>. The
bisulphide of carbon brought to the boiling point (114°
F.) by the steam introduced into the jacket, vaporizes
quickly; the vaporization being still more accelerated
by revolving the stirrer <i>H</i>, by means of the crank <i>G</i>.
The vapors of bisulphide of carbon escape through
four openings in the upper part of the still, into a
capacious worm, the lower part of which enters,
under water, a reservoir.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the volatility of bisulphide of carbon,
the oil retains a portion of it so tenaciously that a
complete separation cannot be accomplished by the
introduction of steam into the jacket <i>B</i>. Hence, in
order to vaporize the last traces of the solvent, air is
introduced into the oil through the pipe <i>K</i>, the lower
end of which is perforated. After completed distillation
the oil is discharged through <i>L</i>.</p>

<p><i>Maceration or infusion.</i>&mdash;This process is employed
for flowers with an inconsiderable content of volatile oil
or whose odoriferous substance would suffer decomposition
or alteration by distillation. The process is
founded on the affinity of odoriferous substances for
fatty bodies which, when impregnated with them, are
called <i>pomades</i>. These are afterwards made to yield the
aroma to strong alcohol, so that finally there is obtained
a solution of the volatile oil in alcohol from which the
pure oil is obtained by distilling off the alcohol. The
fat used, olive oil, lard, etc., should be entirely neutral,
<i>i. e.</i>, free from every trace of acid. The fats are purified
by treating them several times in the heat with
weak soda-lye and then washing carefully with water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
until the last traces of the lye are removed, and the fat
shows no alkaline or acid reaction.</p>

<p>With the use of olive oil the so-called "<i lang="fr">Huiles
antiques</i>" are obtained, which are merely solutions of
volatile oils in the fixed oil. By the use of lard, etc.,
the genuine <i>pomades</i> are obtained, which are directly
used as expensive articles of perfumery, but in the
factories serve as a starting point for the preparation of
volatile oils.</p>

<p>The old process of maceration, which is still in use
in some parts of France, is as follows: A certain quantity
of fat is placed in an enameled iron or porcelain
pan provided with a water or steam bath. When the
fat is melted, the freshly gathered flowers from which
the aroma is to be extracted are thrown in and left to
digest for from twelve to twenty-four hours, the fat being
kept fluid and stirred frequently. When the flowers are
completely exhausted, the fat is strained from them into
fresh pots, in which it is again macerated with fresh
flowers as before. This operation is repeated ten to
fifteen times until the pomade has acquired the desired
strength.</p>

<p>Experience, however, has shown that volatile oils
prepared by this process possess a finer odor the shorter
the time the flowers remain in contact with the fat.
Piver has devised an apparatus which reduces the
time of maceration to the shortest period possible. The
kettle to the left, Fig. 16, supplies the fat heated to the
proper temperature, which circulates slowly through the
macerating tank, in which a constant temperature of
149° F. is maintained by means of a steam pipe. The
macerating tank is divided into compartments, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
baskets containing the vegetable substance to be extracted
are suspended. The basket on the left contains
the substance which has passed through all the compartments;
it is from time to time removed, filled with
fresh substance, and then attached to the right, the
other baskets being moved to the next compartment to
the left. In this way the fresh substance has to traverse
each compartment from right to left, while the fat flows
slowly from left to right, and saturated with the perfume
of the substance collects in the tank on the extreme
right.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 16.</div>
<img src="images/fig_16.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Maceration is employed for the flowers of the orange
(<i>citrus aurantum</i>), of the mock orange (<i>Philadelphus
coronarius</i>), of the acacia (<i>acacia Farnesiana</i>), of the
violet (<i>viola odorata</i>), of the mignonette (<i>réséda odorata</i>),
etc.</p>

<p>The process of <i>absorption</i>, or "<i lang="fr">enfleurage</i>," as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
called by the French, is chiefly made use of for procuring
the odoriferous principle of very delicate flowers,
the delicious odor of which would be greatly modified,
if not entirely spoiled, by the application of heat. The
older apparatus employed for the purpose consists of a
number of shallow wooden frames of about 15×18
inches, inclosing at half their depth a sheet of glass.
The edges of the frame rise about an inch above each
surface of the glass, and, being flat, the frames stand
securely upon one another, forming often considerable
stacks. These frames are called "<i lang="fr">chassis</i>," those just
described being termed "<i lang="fr">chassis aux vitres</i>," or "<i lang="fr">chassis
aux pomades</i>," to distinguish them from a different
form, which is used where oil has to be submitted to
the process of absorption. The process in the case of
pomade is as follows: Each sheet of glass is uniformly
coated with a thin layer of purified grease, care being
taken that the grease does not come in contact with the
woodwork of the frames. The flowers are then thinly
sprinkled, or rather laid, one by one, upon the surface of
the fat, where they are allowed to remain one or two
days, when they are removed and replaced by fresh
ones. The operation is thus continued for twenty-five
or thirty days, until the fat is saturated with aroma.
The frames charged with fat and flowers are stacked
one upon the other, forming, in fact, a number of little
rectangular chambers.</p>

<p>For <i>perfuming oils</i> a metal sieve, Fig. 17, is substituted
for the glass plate. Upon the sieve a piece of
thick cotton cloth saturated with oil is laid, and upon
this the flowers are scattered, and left there until fresh
ones have to be substituted. The operation is repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
until the oil is sufficiently impregnated with aroma, when
the cloth is subjected to pressure and the expressed oil
filtered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 17.</div>
<img src="images/fig_17.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This process is very tedious, requiring much labor
and a long time for the impregnation of the fat or oil,
but, notwithstanding its faults, it is still pursued to a
great extent, some French firms using 3000 such frames
during the season.</p>

<p>With the apparatus, shown in Fig. 18, the process of
absorption can, however, be conducted with very little
expense of labor and time. It has the further advantage
that the flowers do not come in direct contact with the
fat, whereby a saving of the latter is effected, and it is
less liable to rancidity.</p>

<p>The apparatus consists of a tall wooden box provided
with doors which can be hermetically closed. In the
box are placed upon brackets a number of glass plates,
<i>g</i>, so arranged one above the other that, for instance,
those with uneven numbers are on the left side, leaving
an open space to the right, while those with even numbers
are arranged on the right side with an open space
to the left.</p>

<p>From the bottom of the box a pipe passes into a sheet-iron
cylinder, <i>K´</i>, filled loosely with flowers, and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>vided
with lateral openings, <i>O</i> and <i>O´</i>. From the lid
of the box <i>K</i> ascends a pipe, <i>e</i>, which is connected with
a small ventilating apparatus kept in motion by a clockwork
and weights. This ventilator when in motion
sucks a current of air through the apparatus. The air
enters the cylinder <i>K´</i> at <i>O</i>, and after ascending through
the flowers and becoming impregnated with the vapors
of the volatile oil enters through the opening <i>O´</i> into
the box <i>K</i> and, in passing in the direction indicated by
arrows, over the plates coated with fat, yields its aroma
to them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 18.</div>
<img src="images/fig_18.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another apparatus for the same purpose, devised by
Piver, is shown in Fig. 19. The fat is converted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
thin macaroni-like threads and brought upon wire gauze
stretched in frames. The flowers to be extracted are
piled upon tinned metallic plates, and the trays containing
the fat and the flowers are placed in an air-tight
chamber arranged as shown in the illustration. The air
in the chamber is made to circulate to and fro by the
working of a bellows with which the apparatus is provided,
whereby the fat is caused to absorb the odor of
the flowers very rapidly and is less liable to rancidity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 19.</div>
<img src="images/fig_19.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The absorption process is employed for the flowers of
the jasmine (<i>jasminum oderatissimum</i>), the mignonnette
(<i>réséda odorata</i>), the violet (<i>viola tricolor</i>), the tuberose
(<i>polianthes tuberosa</i>), etc.</p>

<p><i>Storage of volatile oils.</i>&mdash;In storing volatile oils, they
should be carefully protected from light and air. Some
oils become darker on exposure to light, while others,
for instance, lemon oil, become colorless. Most volatile
oils, as previously mentioned, absorb oxygen from the
air with avidity and combine chemically with it.
Thinly-fluid oils become perceptibly more thickly-fluid
and finally even rigid, the product of oxidation being a
resinous body. Some volatile oils containing aldehydes
are converted, by the absorption of oxygen, into acids,
cinnamic acid being, for instance, formed in cinnamon
oil, and benzoic acid in oil of bitter almonds.</p>

<p>To prevent evaporation, as well as the above-mentioned
effects of light and air, the volatile oils should
be preserved in not too large glass bottles kept as full
as possible, and closed with a good cork, over which
it is best to tie a piece of bladder. The bottles
should be stored in a cool, shady place. The preservation
of the oils is assisted by the addition of 0.5 to 1 per
cent. of anhydrous alcohol.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2></div>

<p class="subh">TESTING VOLATILE OILS.</p>


<p>Volatile oils are much adulterated, the adulterations
consisting chiefly in mixing an expensive oil with a
cheaper one and with alcohol; more rarely with chloroform
and fat oils. To these adulterations, which have
been common for many years, has recently been added
the previously mentioned hydrocarbon called terpene
or camphene, which is separated in the preparation of
concentrated oils.</p>

<p>For the recognition of the quality of a volatile oil,
serve first of all its physical properties, especially its
color, odor and taste. The specific gravity varies too
much and is not always a sufficient criterion. Reagents
can only be employed with a few oils. The chemical
detection of adulterations is rendered especially difficult
by the fact, that most of the volatile oils form a mixture
of terpenes with other combinations, in which the separate
constituent parts do not appear in fixed, but in
changeable proportions, and in which the constituents
themselves suffer alteration by storing, air and light.</p>

<p><i>Odor and taste</i> are so characteristic for every volatile
oil as to suffice in most cases. For testing as to odor,
bring a drop of the oil to be examined upon the dry
palm of one hand and for some time rub with the other,
whereby the odor is more perceptibly brought out. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
determine the taste, vigorously shake one drop of the oil
with 15 to 20 grammes of distilled water and then test
with the tongue.</p>

<p>An adulteration with <i>fat oil</i> (poppy oil, castor oil) may
be recognized as follows: Place a drop of the suspected
oil upon blotting paper and expose it to the heat of the
water bath. If it evaporates completely and no stain is
perceptible, the oil is pure. But frequently a transparent
stain remains with old oils without their being adulterated,
which is due to the resin formed by the absorption
of oxygen and remaining dissolved in the oil. In
this case a transparent ring is generally formed by the
concentration of the resin on the edges of the stain. If
no tangible results are obtained by this test, pour a few
cubic centimeters of the oil upon a watch-crystal and
heat it very slowly upon a piece of sheet-iron, until all
the odor has disappeared. If the watch-crystal becomes
empty in a short time, nothing but volatile oil
was present; but if a viscous residue remains, this may
consist either of fatty oil or resin, or of both. Treat the
residue with strong alcohol; if it dissolves it may be
resin or castor oil. Dilute the solution with much
water; a white flocculent turbidity indicates resin; the
separation of an oily liquid, after standing, castor oil. If
the residue remains undissolved, it consists of a fatty oil,
generally oil of almond or olive.</p>

<p>The presence of castor oil can be accurately determined
by bringing the residue from the watch-crystal
into a test-tube by means of a glass-rod, and compounding
it with a few drops of nitric acid. A strong
development of gas takes place, after the cessation of
which, solution of carbonate of soda is added as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
there is any sign of effervescence. If the added oil was
castor oil, the contents of the test-tube will show a
peculiar odor due to œnanthylic acid formed by the action
of nitric acid upon castor oil.</p>

<p>Another method of establishing the presence of fat oil
consists in mixing the suspected oil with eight times its
quantity of 90 per cent. alcohol (specific gravity 0.823).
If the oil is unadulterated a clear solution is formed; if
it contains fat oil, the latter remains undissolved. The
presence of castor oil, which of the fat oils is chiefly
used for adulteration, is, however, not shown by this
method, it being also soluble in alcohol.</p>

<p>A permanent stain upon the paper may, however,
also be formed by fresh oils obtained by expression from
the respective parts of the plant. Thus, lemon oil obtained
by expression from the peel, and which has a far
more agreeable odor than that produced by distillation,
always leaves behind a slight grease-stain.</p>

<p><i>Detection of alcohol or spirit of wine.</i>&mdash;Independent
of the alcohol added to assist the preservation of some
oils, adulteration with alcohol frequently occurs, especially
in expensive oils. With a content of not more
than 3 per cent. of alcohol, it suffices to allow one to
two drops of the suspected oil to fall into water. In
the presence of alcohol, the drop becomes either immediately
surrounded with a milky zone, or it becomes
turbid or whitish after being for some time in contact
with the water. Dragendorff's test is based upon the
fact that oils, which are hydrocarbons, suffer no change
by the addition of sodium (ten drops of oil and a small
chip of sodium), while oils containing hydrocarbons and
oxygenated oils cause with sodium a slight evolution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
hydrogen gas, and suffer but a slight change during the
first five to ten minutes of the reaction. If, however,
the oil is adulterated with alcohol, not only a violent
evolution of hydrogen gas takes place, but the oil in a
short time becomes brown or dark brown, thickly fluid
or rigid.</p>

<p>The detection of alcohol by means of fuchsine, which
has been frequently recommended, requires special precautions.
It must first be ascertained that the oil is free
from acids and water; if such is not the case, they must
be removed by means of caustic potash. After settling,
bring, by means of a dry pipette, about five cubic centimeters
of the oil into a dry test-tube about ten millimeters
in diameter, without moistening the walls of the
upper half of the tube. Then bring, by means of a
paper gutter, a few milligrammes of coarsely-powdered
fuchsine into the dry part of the obliquely held tube, at
a distance of one centimeter from the oil. Now heat
gradually over a lamp until the tube begins to tarnish.
With pure oil no evaporation is observed, but if the oil
contains only 0.1 per cent. of alcohol, every speck of
fuchsine will, after heating to boiling and setting aside,
be surrounded by a stain produced by the alcoholic
solution. The chief requirement for this test is that the
oil be free from water. If such is not the case, vapors will
be observed, which condense in the upper portion of the
test-tube, and dissolve fuchsine, and, after flowing back,
sink below the oil with a crackling noise. If the oil
contains alcohol, the condensing vapors dissolve fuchsine
with greater ease, and in flowing back mix without
crackling.</p>

<p>Hager's tannin test is very reliable. Bring into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
test-tube 5 to 10 drops of the oil to be examined, add a
piece of tannin the size of a pea, shake so that the
tannin is moistened by the oil, and let the whole stand
at a temperature of 59° to 68° F. In most volatile
oils tannin is insoluble, and, if the oil is pure, floats for
days on the surface without change. If, however, the
oil contains alcohol, the tannin absorbs the latter, according
to the quantity present, in 3 to 48 hours, and forms
with it a more or less transparent, viscous, tough, or
smeary mass resembling a soft resin, which settles on
the bottom, and adheres so firmly to it, as well as to
the sides of the tube, that it cannot be moved by shaking.
The mass may be examined as to its consistency
with a knitting needle. Traces of moisture in the oil
are not detrimental to the test, the tannin mass separating
in the form of a hyaline mass only in few oils, and
if this mass is tested with the knitting needle it will be
found not tough or smeary, but hard, and may sometimes
be divided into small grains. With oil of bitter
almonds, cassia oil, and some oils of clove, as well as
volatile oil containing an acid, the tannin test is not
available. The first two oils even dissolve tannin, and
large quantities of it, if they contain alcohol.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned oils may, however, be rendered
fit for the tannin test by mixing them with double their
volume of benzine or petroleum-ether, and allowing the
mixture to stand for two or three days. If, however,
the oils contain much alcohol, the tannin is dissolved.
The use of powdered tannin is not advisable, because it
generally deposits in a thin layer on the bottom, and its
alteration is not so perceptible. If, for practical reasons,
a content of 0.5 per cent. anhydrous alcohol might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
accepted as permissible in a volatile oil, the tannin test
would have to be so modified as to mix 10 drops of
the oil with a piece of tannin the size of two peas,
and allow the whole to stand for one hour. In this
time the above-mentioned content of alcohol would yield
no result.</p>

<p><i>Detection of chloroform.</i>&mdash;An adulteration with chloroform,
if moderate, cannot always be detected by the
odor and taste. In most cases, chloroform will considerably
increase the specific gravity of the oil. Bring
into a test-tube 15 drops of the suspected oil, 45 to 90
drops of alcohol, and 30 to 40 drops of dilute sulphuric
acid. After thorough shaking, add 2 or 3 shavings of
zinc sheet and heat until a vigorous evolution of hydrogen
takes place. After again shaking, set the whole
aside, and heat again when the evolution of gas becomes
weaker. This heating and gentle shaking of the fluid is
several times repeated. After 20 to 25 minutes, compound
the fluid with an equal volume of cold distilled
water, shake vigorously and filter through a paper-filter
moistened with water. Strongly acidulate the filtrate
with nitric acid and compound with nitrate of silver
solution. If chloroform is present, turbidity or a precipitate
of chloride of silver appears.</p>

<p><i>Detection of benzine.</i>&mdash;An adulteration with benzine
can be readily detected only in oils specifically heavier
than water. The separation of benzine is effected by
distillation from a small glass flask in the water bath.
The distillate together with an equal volume of nitric
acid of 1.5 specific gravity is gently heated in a test-tube.
A too vigorous reaction is modified by cooling in
cold water, and a too sluggish action quickened by gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
heating (dipping in warm water). If the mixture has a
yellow color, dilute it with water, shake with ether,
mix the decanted ethereal solution with alcohol and hydrochloric
acid, add some zinc and place the whole in a
lukewarm place to convert the nitrobenzol formed into
aniline. After evolution of hydrogen is done, neutralize
with potash lye, shake, take off the layer of ether, let the
latter evaporate and add to the residue a few drops of
calcium chloride solution. If benzine is present, a
blue-violet color reaction takes place.</p>

<p>Adulterations with alcohol, chloroform, and benzine
are quantitatively determined by bringing a weighed
quantity of the oil into a glass flask so that it occupies
about four-fifths of the volume of the flask. Place
upon the flask a cork through which has been passed a
glass-tube bent at a right angle and provided with a
cylindrical glass vessel serving as a receiver and heating
in the water bath. If the distance from the level of the
oil to the angle of the glass tube in which it inclines
downwards, amounts, for instance, to 4.72 inches, and
the neck of the flask up to its angle is 2.75 inches high
outside of the direct effect of the heat of the water bath,
only the above-mentioned adulterants distill over, while
the vapor of the volatile oil condenses at a height of 2.75
inches and flows back into the flask. The distillate is
weighed and examined as to its derivation. First add
one cubic centimeter of it to two or three cubic centimeters
of potassium acetate solution of specific gravity
1.197 and shake moderately. If a clear mixture results,
alcohol alone is present. If, however, the mixture is
not clear, and the distilled fluid sinks down and collects
on the bottom of the test-tube, chloroform is very likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
present, and if it remains floating upon the acetate solution,
benzine. Next bring two to three centimeters of
the distillate into a test-tube and add a piece of sodium
metal, the size of a pea. If violent foaming, <i>i. e.</i>, an
evolution of gas, takes place, alcohol is certainly
present, and possibly also chloroform and benzine
towards which sodium is indifferent. However, in the
presence of benzine, the sodium solution would be
colorless, and in the presence of chloroform, yellowish
and turbid. In case the sodium produces no reaction
and alcohol is, therefore, not present, add an equal volume
(two to three cubic centimeters) of anhydrous alcohol,
and after moderately shaking allow the solution of
the sodium and the evolution of gas to proceed, whereby
benzine produces a nearly colorless, turbid fluid, and
chloroform a yellowish, milky one. Now dilute the
fluid with an equal or double volume of water, shake
and allow the mixture to stand quietly. In the presence
of benzine a colorless, turbid layer collects on the bottom
of the fluid, while that collecting in the presence
of chloroform is yellowish. In the latter case, <i>i. e.</i>, in the
presence of chloroform, the aqueous filtrate yields with
lead acetate solution a white precipitate (lead chloride
and lead hydroxide). The adulterant having thus been
recognized, further particulars are learned from the
specific gravity of the oil as well as of the distillate.</p>

<p>Adulterations with <i>terpenes</i> or <i>terpene-like fluids</i>, such
as are gained in the preparation of concentrated or
patent oils, are difficult to recognize. They may be
detected by the specific gravity, the terpenes being, as
a rule, specifically lighter, their specific gravity varying
between 0.840 and 0.870.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>The detection of <i>adulterations with volatile oils of a
lower quality</i> is very difficult, if not led to it by the odor
and taste. Many methods for establishing such adulterations
have been proposed, of which the following are
the most important:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Test with iodine.</i>&mdash;This test is based upon the fact
that some oils violently detonate with iodine, while
others develop heat and vapors, and others again remain
indifferent. For this test pour upon about 0.19 gramme
of dry iodine in a watch-crystal 4 to 6 drops of the oil
to be examined.</p>

<p>1. A vigorous reaction (detonation) with considerable
increase in the temperature and emission of vapors takes
place with the following oils: oils of bergamot, lemon,
lavender, nutmeg, orange peel, spike, turpentine, wormwood.</p>

<p>2. Such a reaction as mentioned under 1, does not
take place with oils of bitter almonds, copaiba, calamus,
clove, peppermint, rose.</p>

<p>3. Moderate heating and slight vapors are developed
with oils of anise-seed, fennel, camomile, curly mint,
marjoram, rosemary, sassafras, thyme.</p>

<p>When an oil of the second series becomes heated with
iodine and evolves vapors, it may first of all be adulterated
with cheaper oils. This may also be the case
when an oil of the third series reacts violently with
iodine and evolves vapors with strong heating. Formerly
the iodine test was highly valued; it has, however,
been shown to be unreliable since it is frequently
dependent on the age of the oil.</p>

<p>In place of iodine, Rudolph Eck recommends a very
dilute alcoholic iodine solution, which is not discolored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
by oils of turpentine, while other oils discolor it. Dissolve
a drop of the oil to be examined in 3 cubic centimeters
of 90 to 100 per cent. alcohol, and add a drop
of the iodine solution. The latter is not discolored in
the presence of an oil of turpentine. There are also,
however, several volatile oils, which do not discolor the
iodine solution. Mierzinski mentions the following:
All cold-expressed oils from the <i>Aurantiaceæ</i>, further
oils of coriander, caraway, galanga, rue, sassafras, rose,
rosemary, anise-seed, fennel, calamus, neroli, angelica,
wormwood. Hence, this reaction cannot be relied upon.</p>

<p>II. <i>Hoppe's nitroprusside of copper test.</i>&mdash;This test
sometimes gives good results, but only with hydrocarbons
absolutely free from oxygen and oxygenated oils.
It is, therefore, not suitable for oils derived from the
<i>Aurantiaceæ</i>. The process is as follows: Add to a
small quantity of the oil to be examined in a perfectly
dry test-tube, 2 to 5 milligrammes of pure
nitroprusside of copper previously thoroughly dried
and finely pulverized, shake vigorously and gradually
heat to boiling. After boiling for a few seconds
allow to cool. If the oil is free from oil of turpentine,
or another oil containing no oxygen, the precipitate
formed is brown, black, or gray, and according to
the quantity of the reagent added and the original
color of the oil, the supernatant oil will be differently
colored and appear more or less dark. If, however, the
oil is adulterated with oil of turpentine, the precipitate
formed shows a handsome green or blue-green color,
while the supernatant oil retains its original color or at
the utmost acquires a very slightly darker one. The
longer the oil is allowed to stand after settling, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
distinct and beautiful the color of the oil and of the precipitate
appears. For the establishment and certain
recognition of very small quantities of oil of turpentine
in oxygenated oils, it is best to first add very little of
the nitroprusside of copper to the oil to be tested, and
a larger quantity only after being convinced either of
the purity or adulteration of the oil. This is done to be
able, on the one hand, better to judge the reaction, if the
oil is pure, and, on the other, if it is adulterated, to
establish such adulteration with certainty and to approximately
estimate the quantity of oil of turpentine
present. The less nitroprusside of copper is used, the
better small quantities of oil of turpentine can be
detected.</p>

<p>Nearly all volatile oils free from oxygen show the
same behavior towards nitroprusside of copper; they
decompose it, which is not the case with oxygenated oils.
The behavior of the latter is shown in the following
table:&mdash;</p>

<p>If these oxygenated oils are mixed with oils free from
oxygen, for instance, oil of turpentine, they show exactly
the same behavior as oils free from oxygen; the nitroprusside
of copper is not decomposed and retains its
gray-green color. If, for instance, oil of cloves is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
mixed with oil of turpentine, the red coloration by
nitroprusside of copper does not appear.</p>

<p>III. <i>Hager's alcohol and sulphuric acid test.</i>&mdash;Bring
into a test-tube of about 0.5 inch diameter, five to six
drops of the oil to be tested and twenty-five to thirty drops
of pure concentrated sulphuric acid, and mix the two fluids
by shaking, whereby either no heating takes place or a
scarcely perceptible one, or the heating is strong or very
vigorous and in some cases increased to the evolution of
vapors. The mixture is either clear or turbid. After
complete cooling, add to the mixture eight to ten cubic
centimeters of 90 per cent. alcohol, and after closing the
tube with the finger, shake vigorously. The mixture
now shows a different color, is clear or turbid, and the
deposit formed after standing for one day is also differently
colored and either soluble or insoluble in boiling
alcohol.</p>

<p>The mixture of oil, sulphuric acid and alcohol is perfectly
clear and transparent with oils of bitter almonds,
fennel, clove and rose; with anise-seed oil and star anise-seed
oil only the alcoholic layer over the mixture of sulphuric
acid and oil is clear. The mixture of oil, acid and
alcohol is slightly turbid or nearly clear with oils of
valerian, peppermint and field thyme. With most of the
other volatile oils occurring in commerce, the mixture
is more or less milky turbid. Heating of the oil and acid
mixtures does not take place with pyrogenous oils (petroleum,
benzine) or only to a very slight degree, as with
oils of peppermint and mustard.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Hager's guaiacum reaction</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> serves for the detec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>tion
of oil of turpentine in a volatile oil. By pouring upon
as much guaiacum, freshly powdered, as will lie upon the
point of a small knife, in a test-tube 1 cubic centimeter
(25 drops) of spike oil, and heating nearly to boiling
over a petroleum lamp, the oil after being removed
from the flame and allowing the undissolved resin to
settle, shows a <i>yellow</i> color. By now pouring upon an
equal quantity of guaiacum in another test-tube 25 drops
of spike oil and 5 drops of rectified oil of t
from the flame shows a <i>dark violet color</i>.
Various other oils behave in the same manner as spike
oil, and hence a content of oil of turpentine can be
readily detected in them. Other oils do not exhibit this
behavior; but this can be remedied by adding, in testing
for oil of turpentine, a few drops of an oil of the
first class.</p>

<p>The guaiacum reaction is an ozone reaction and with
reference to this, the volatile oils may be divided into
three classes:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a. Oils inclining to the formation of ozone.</i>&mdash;Foremost
of these is oil of turpentine, especially when rectified.
Oils of tansy, rue, mint, juniper, zedoary, etc., show considerably
less inclination.</p>

<p><i>b. Oils which, especially when heated, directly incite the
oil of turpentine to form ozone, and to color guaiacum
violet or blue.</i>&mdash;Such oils are many kinds of oil of citronella,
oils of spike, calamus, cedar, etc.</p>

<p><i>c. Oils with a content of oil of turpentine, which remain
indifferent towards guaiacum.</i>&mdash;To such oils, if to
be tested for oil of turpentine, with the assistance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
guaiacum reaction, a few drops of an oil of the second
class have to be added.</p>

<p>V. <i>Hübl's iodine method.</i>&mdash;Mr. C. Barenthin has
applied Hübl's iodine method for fixed oils to the
examination of volatile oils. He uses the following
solutions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Fifty grammes iodine and 60 grammes of mercuric
chloride in a liter of alcohol freed from fusel oil, and
let stand for 12 hours.</p>

<p>2. Twenty-four grammes of hyposulphite of sodium
in a liter of water.</p>

<p>3. A ten per cent. solution of iodide of potassium.
Dissolve 0.1 to 0.2 gramme of the volatile oil in 10
cubic centimeters of chloroform, and add first 15 cubic
centimeters of the iodine-mercuric chloride solution; let
stand three or four hours, and, in case the mixture gets
discolored, add a few more centimeters of solution. Now
add 10 to 15 cubic centimeters iodide of potassium
solution, dilute with 150 cubic centimeters of water, and
titrate with hyposulphite till the mixture remains clear
for about a minute. The iodide of potassium solution
must be added before the water, and the relative proportions
between this solution and the iodine-mercuric
chloride solution must be 15 to 20 cubic centimeters.
The quantity of iodine solution consumed is calculated
to iodine for 100 parts and the figure thus obtained is
designated as the "iodine number."</p>

<p>Barenthin has in this manner determined the iodine
number of several volatile oils; other experimenters,
however, for instance, Kremel and Davies,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
different numbers for the same oils, so that this method
requires further thorough examination before it can be
classed as available.</p>

<p>VI. A. Kremel has endeavored to utilize <i>titration
or saponification with alcoholic potash lye</i> for the examination
of volatile oils. In his experiments he was guided
by the following points: A series of volatile oils contains
partially free organic acids, like oils of bitter almonds
and cinnamon, and partially aldehydes or other combinations.
Now it seems not impossible, that up to a certain
limit, the quantities of these combinations in the separate
volatile oils remain constant, thus presenting the opportunity
of testing the respective oils as to their quality
and purity by saponification. In some cases these combinations
are the chief bearers of the specific odor, and
hence the determination of the "<i>saponification number</i>"
becomes of double value. It is, of course, self-evident
that not every volatile oil can be saponified, and Kremel
admits that, even where saponification takes place, it is
not in every case a sure test.</p>

<p>The execution of the method is as follows: Dissolve
1 gramme of the oil to be examined in 2 to 3 cubic centimeters
of 90 per cent. alcohol freed from acid, compound
the solution with a few drops of phenol-phthalein
solution, and titrate the free acid with &frac12; normal alcoholic
potash lye. The milligrammes of caustic potash used
are designated the "<i>acid number</i>." After having thus
determined the content of acid, add to the same solution
10 cubic centimeters of the same potash lye, heat
for &frac14; hour upon the water bath, and then titrate back the
excess of potash lye with &frac12; normal hydrochloric acid.
In this manner the "<i>saponification number</i>" is obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
(In some cases when the final reaction is not plainly perceptible,
it is advisable to correspondingly dilute with
water after heating the alcoholic fluid.) The saponification
number, less the acid number, gives the "<i>ether</i>
or <i>ester number</i>."</p>

<p>Kremel has in this manner examined a large number
of volatile oils and partially obtained surprising results.
Rose oil gives a saponification number of 12, and
geranium oils one of 40 to 50. While lavender oils
give very high saponification numbers, oil of lemons does
not. Artificial oil of bitter almonds shows higher
saponification numbers than the natural oil. By further
compounding the saponified portions of the latter with
acid, a crystalline precipitate of benzoin is formed, the
quantity of which amounts to from 40 to 50 per cent. of
the oil used. Such a precipitate, but only in very small
quantities, is also formed in peach kernel oil, but not in
other similar oils nor in artificial oil of bitter almonds.</p>

<p>VII. F. R. Williams has recently endeavored to
utilize for testing volatile oils Maumené's test, which is
based upon the increase in temperature produced in oils
by concentrated sulphuric acid, and which gives valuable
points for the examination of some fat oils. Of course,
the large quantities of oil otherwise prescribed cannot be
used. While for the examination of fat oils 50 grammes
of oil are mixed with 10 cubic centimeters of concentrated
sulphuric acid in a beaker glass wrapped around
with cotton, Williams could use only six cubic centimeters
of volatile oil. They were brought into a very
small beaker glass enveloped in cotton. After reading
off the temperature, twelve cubic centimeters of concentrated
sulphuric acid were added and the whole stirred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
with the thermometer until the temperature no longer
rose. Numbers were in this manner obtained which
might in some cases, for instance, cassia oil, furnish
guiding points for judging the purity of the oil.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2></div>

<p class="subh">THE VOLATILE OILS USED IN PERFUMERY.</p>


<p>The volatile oils, as previously mentioned, may be divided
into three groups, viz: the pure hydrocarbons,
oxygenated oils, and sulphuretted oils. Chemically, this
division is, however, of little value, since, among bodies
which should be classed according to it in one of the
groups, combinations are found which vary very much
in a chemical respect, and belong partially in the groups
of alcohols, indifferent bodies, acids, etc.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, preferred not to attempt a classification
of the volatile oils according to their chemical composition,
but simply to enumerate them in alphabetical
order.</p>

<p><i>Acacia, oil of</i>, commonly called <i>oil of cassie</i>. The
flowers or buds of the <i>acacia Farnesiana</i> yield a somewhat
thickly-fluid, greenish-yellow oil of a very intense
but delightful odor. The oil may be obtained either by
extraction or absorption. The acacia is cultivated in
special plantations along the <i>Riviera di Genova</i>. These
plantations being controlled by a few perfumers, the oil
is not allowed to reach the market, and does not form an
article of commerce. The green-colored <i>extrait d'acacia</i>
is a solution of the oil in alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Almond oil</i> (<i>bitter</i>) (<i>oleum amygdalae amaræ</i>) is obtained
by submitting bitter almond cake (left after the expres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>sion
of the fixed oil from bitter almonds) to distillation
with water. The volatile oil does not exist ready
formed in the bitter almond, nor in the almond cake,
but results from the decomposition of a glucoside called
"amygdalin," contained in the cake, under the influence
of emulsin and water, the emulsin acting as a ferment,
into benzylic aldehyde, glucose and prussic acid. The
almond tree grows wild, but is also cultivated in Southern
Europe, Africa, Barbary, Palestine and Syria. The
bitter almonds brought from Barbary are considered the
best. Besides, in almonds, amygdalin occurs in various
other plants; for instance, in the leaves of the cherry
laurel, the leaves and kernels of the peach, the kernels
of the black cherry and other varieties of <i>prunus</i> and
<i>amygdalus</i>, they all yielding, after maceration with
water, a distillate containing prussic acid and oil of
bitter almonds.</p>

<p>Instead of the comparatively expensive bitter almonds,
peach kernels freed from their hard shells are extensively
used in the fabrication of oil of bitter almonds. The oil
is prepared as follows: The press cakes of bitter almonds
or peach kernels are ground and soaked about twenty-four
hours in twice their weight of water to which one-third
their weight of salt has been added. The whole
is then submitted to distillation. The temperature of
the water should not exceed 113° to 122° F. The
emulsin contained in the almonds possesses only within
certain limits of temperature the power of decomposing
amygdalin, and, if heated to 176° F., becomes inoperative.
Hence, if the almond paste is quickly heated to
boiling, the emulsin becomes inoperative before all the
amygdalin is decomposed, and a portion of it being con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>sequently
lost, the yield is insufficient. The distillation
of the almond paste is effected in a current of steam.</p>

<p>A portion of the prussic acid formed by the decomposition
of the amygdalin adheres tenaciously to the oil.
This content of prussic acid makes the oil of bitter
almonds exceedingly poisonous, while in itself it is non-poisonous.
It can be freed from the prussic acid by
shaking with ferrous sulphate (blue vitriol) solution.
By then distilling over burnt lime the originally yellow
or yellowish oil is obtained colorless. It is then thinly
fluid, of a peculiar agreeable odor and strongly nutty
taste. Its specific gravity is 1.043 at 59° F., but varies
a little with age. It boils at 356° F., and dissolves in
13 parts of water, but more readily in alcohol and ether.
In the air it is rapidly converted into benzoic acid by
the absorption of oxygen. It has to be carefully protected
from air and light and kept in well-closed bottles
in a dark place. The crude oil, containing from 2 to 5
per cent. prussic acid, has generally a yellowish color.</p>

<p>Oil of bitter almonds may be prepared artificially in
many ways. By allowing chlorine to flow into boiling
toluene, the latter is converted into benzyl chloride:-</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="center">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)</td><td align="center">+ Cl<sub>2</sub> =</td><td align="center">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>Cl)</td><td align="center">+ HCl</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><small>toluene</small></td><td align="center"><small>chlorine</small></td><td align="center"><small>benzyl chloride</small></td><td align="center"><small>hydrogen chloride</small></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>By withdrawing the chlorine and one atom hydrogen
from the benzyl chloride and introducing for it one
atom oxygen, the benzyl chloride is converted into benzaldehyde.
This conversion is readily effected by continuously
boiling, best with the introduction of carbonic
acid, 1 part of benzyl chloride with 1&frac12; parts of lead
nitrate and 10 parts of water, and finally distilling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
benzaldehyde off by steam. The decomposition takes
place according to the following equation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
2[C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>Cl)] + Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)2 =<br />
2[C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(CHO)] + PbCl<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The crude benzaldehyde thus obtained is agitated
with warm solution of acid sodium sulphite, the solution
formed thereby is separated from undissolved
oily particles and cooled, whereby a combination of
benzaldehyde with acid sodium sulphate crystallizes
out. This combination is separated from the remaining
fluid, decomposed by acid and submitted
to distillation, whereby benzaldehyde passes over.
Large quantities of benzaldehyde are at present prepared
according to this method. The identity of
benzaldehyde with oil of bitter almonds has been
established by Lippmann and Hawliczek.</p>

<p>Genuine oil of almonds is much adulterated, chiefly
with alcohol, nitrobenzole, and various cheaper oils.
An addition of 3 to 5 per cent. of alcohol is frequently
made by Italian dealers in order to conceal a content of
water, which at a low temperature is apt to render the
oil turbid. To detect the presence of alcohol, moderately
heat a sample of the oil in a distilling apparatus
and compound the drops, first passing over with sodium
carbonate solution and then with potassium iodide solution.
In the presence of alcohol a yellowish crystalline
precipitate of iodoform is formed.</p>

<p>An addition of synthetically composed oil might seem
of no importance, since the natural oil does not differ
from it. However, for very fine perfumery the natural
oil cannot be replaced by the artificial, it having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
thus far impossible to obtain the latter absolutely chemically
pure. It always contains small quantities of
undecomposed chlorine combinations which injure the
taste and odor. To detect such oil in the natural oil,
bring a few drops upon a tuft of cotton and ignite it.
Over the burning flame invert a beaker moistened inside
with water. On the moist sides of the beaker the soot
and hydrochloric acid formed by the combustion of the
chlorine combination are precipitated. When the flame
is extinguished, the beaker is rinsed out with water, the
fluid filtered and tested for chlorine with nitrate of
silver. An addition of 10 per cent. artificial oil can in
this manner be accurately determined.</p>

<p>If genuine oil of bitter almonds containing prussic acid,
be heated with an excess of alcoholic potash lye, and the
excess of the latter be neutralized with hydrochloric acid,
benzoin amounting to 40 to 50 per cent. of the weight of
oil of bitter almonds is, according to A. Kremel, separated.
By subjecting artificial oil of bitter almonds to the same
treatment, no benzoin is separated, so that the genuine
oil can in this manner be distinguished from the artificial.
Kremel further found that oil of bitter almonds
prepared from apricot kernels, when treated in an analogous
manner, yielded considerably less benzoin, and
that cherry-laurel oil containing prussic acid, which has
been considered identical with oil of bitter almonds, separated
no benzoin whatever. Should further experiments
prove the constancy of this phenomenon, this reaction
would be a convenient means of distinguishing the four
products.</p>

<p>An adulteration with nitrobenzole and other volatile
oils is recognized by mixing 2 drops of the oil with 100<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
drops of distilled water, and shaking vigorously. Pure
oil must completely dissolve. However, the test yields
accurate results only with the use of actually pure distilled
water and by accurately observing the above-mentioned
proportions. If to 5 cubic centimeters of 90
per cent. alcohol and an equal quantity of distilled water
in a test-tube, 10 drops of the oil be added, and, after
closing the tube with the finger, mixture be effected by
gently turning the tube twice upside down, a clear solution
will immediately result if the oil is pure. If, however,
it contains nitrobenzole, even only 1 per cent., the latter
separates, at first rendering the fluid turbid, but in the
course of a minute, when gently agitated, it floats in the
form of minute drops upon the fluid, while, when at
rest, these drops collect to larger ones on the bottom of
the test-tube. If the oil becomes only turbid, adulteration
with other volatile oils is indicated. Another test,
given by Wagner, is based upon the difference in the
specific gravity of mixtures of oil of bitter almonds with
oil of mirbane. The specific gravity of commercial oil
of bitter almonds varies between 1.040 and 1.043 and
that of oil of mirbane between 1.180 and 1.201.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
5 c. c. of pure oil of bitter almonds weigh 5.29 grammes.<br />

</p></blockquote>

<p>Oil of bitter almonds is much used in the fabrication
of perfumery. In a pure state its odor is by no means
agreeable, but rather strong and stupefying. When
strongly diluted it is, however, very pleasant.</p>

<p><i>Angelica oil</i> is obtained by distillation with water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
from the root of <i>Angelica Archangelica L.</i>, natural
order <i>Umbelliferae</i>. The oil is lighter than water, possesses
the spicy odor of the root and an aromatic pungent
taste. It consists mostly of a terpene which turns
the plane of polarization to the right, and boils at
320° F.</p>

<p>Besides the oil from the root, one obtained from the
seeds also occurs in commerce. It is, however, more
expensive. In a fresh state it is amber-yellow, and has
a specific gravity of 0.8549 at 59° F.; older oil is
thickly-fluid, brown, and has a specific gravity of O.9086.
It contains a terpene which turns the plane of polarization
to the right, and has a lemon-like odor. It is
used for fine perfumery.</p>

<p><i>Anise-seed oil</i> (<i>oleum anisi</i>). The anise (<i>Pimpinella
anisum L.</i>), natural order <i>Umbelliferae</i>, contains volatile
oil in all parts, but chiefly in the seeds. Dry anise-seed
yields by distillation 2&frac12; to 3 per cent. of oil, while the
peduncle and chaff contain at the utmost 1 per cent. of
oil, which is said to be richer in stearoptene. The anise-seed
oil prepared in Southern Russia has always been
highly valued, but as it is generally considerably adulterated,
the Leipsic manufacturers of volatile oils prefer
to import the seed and distill it themselves.</p>

<p>Freshly prepared anise-seed oil is colorless or straw-yellow,
has the odor of anise and a sweetish taste, leaving
a burning sensation upon the tongue. It is thinly
fluid at 68° F., but commences to congeal at a somewhat
lower temperature, and the sooner the more stearoptene
it contains. Good oil should become solid at from 57.2°
to 60.8° F. It has a specific gravity of 0.980 to 0.995
at 59° F. The specific gravity varies with the content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of stearoptene; the greater the latter the higher the
specific gravity. Good anise-seed oil contains 5 to 10 per
cent. of terpene and 90 to 95 per cent. of a stearoptene,
called anethol, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O, on which the value of the oil
depends. The anethol can be separated from the oil by
cooling to 32° F., and forms colorless crystals. It has
an agreeable odor and intensely sweet taste, is sparingly
soluble in water, but readily in alcohol, ether, and other
solvents of volatile oils. Good anethol has a specific
gravity of 0.986, and melts at 69° to 70° F. By frequent
contact with the air a small portion of the anethol
is oxidized, very likely to anisaldehyde. By this process
the specific gravity is raised and the melting point
lowered.</p>

<p>Anise-seed oil is soluble in 5 parts of 90 per cent.
alcohol, and with 3&frac12; times its volume of petroleum-ether
yields a clear mixture. Its mixture with four
times its weight of petroleum-ether is turbid, but becomes
clear in ten minutes, while that with five times
its volume of petroleum-ether remains for a longer time
turbid. In a fluid state the oil, when exposed to the
air, becomes resinous and loses its property to crystallize.
It should, therefore, be kept in tightly-closed
bottles in a cool, shady place.</p>

<p>Anise-seed oil is used in perfuming soaps and mouth
waters. It should, however, be used with prudence,
since the sweetish, penetrating odor of the oil readily
overcomes the other volatile oils in the mixture, and renders
them inoperative.</p>

<p><i>Star anise oil</i> very much resembles the ordinary anise-seed
oil. It is obtained from star anise, the fruit of
<i>Illicium anisatum</i>, a tree formerly supposed to be indige<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>nous
to Cochin China, and cultivated in China, Japan,
and the Phillipine Islands. However, according to
Messrs. Bourgeoin-Meiffre, a French firm of Hanoï
(Tonkin), the star anise oil found in commerce is exclusively
produced in the French colony Tonkin (Province
Langson), the French government having made over the
entire sale of the oil to the above-mentioned firm.</p>

<p>According to a memoir published by Dr. Blondel, of
Paris, the star anise tree is not indigenous to the Chinese
provinces Yunnan, Quang-si, and Fo-Rien, but to the
province Langson, which has by conquest passed into
French possession. Hence, the producers of star anise
and star anise oil are now under French control and, as
it seems, are obliged to sell all the oil produced to the
above-mentioned firm. If these statements should
prove correct, the Chinese harbors Macao and Hong
Kong, from which the greater portion of star anise oil
was formerly exported, will lose their importance in this
respect and the product find its way direct from Hanoï
<i>via</i> Hayphong to Marseilles. The first shipment from
Bourgeoin-Meiffre arrived in Europe in December, 1890.
According to Messrs. Schimmel &amp; Co.'s report, the product
is put up and packed exactly like that formerly
shipped from Hong Kong, and the oil of excellent quality.</p>

<p>Star anise oil differs from the ordinary oil in containing
a much smaller quantity of anethol, and hence
congealing only at a temperature of from 41° to 50° F.
Besides the odor of the terpene contained in star anise
oil differs from that of the ordinary oil. Admixtures of
star anise oil can, therefore, be generally recognized by
the odor. Other methods recommended for its detection
are unreliable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Balm oil.</i>&mdash;The leaves of this plant, <i>Melissa officinalis</i>,
yield by distillation a volatile oil sometimes called oil of
melissa. It is colorless or yellowish, of a pleasant odor,
has a specific gravity of 0.85 to 0.92, shows a slightly
acid reaction and dissolves in 2 to 3 parts of alcohol.
It must not be confounded with the so-called East
India oil of melissa or citronella oil from <i>Andropogon
Nardus L.</i> Balm oil is occasionally used in the preparation
of <i lang="fr">eau de Cologne</i>.</p>

<p><i>Basil oil</i> is distilled in Southern France from the fresh
leaves of <i>Ocymum basilicum L.</i>, natural order <i>Labiatæ</i>.
The oil shows the peculiar odor of the herb and crystallizes
a few degrees above 32° F. In perfumery it is
used as an addition to violet and other preparations.
The French also prepare a <i lang="fr">pommade basilique</i>, which
serves as a cheap substitute for violet pomade.</p>

<p><i>Bayberry oil</i>, or <i>oil of bay leaves</i>, is extracted by distillation
from the leaves of <i>Myrcia acris</i> or the bayberry
tree. Many varieties of the tree exist throughout
the West Indies, which are scarcely to be distinguished
botanically, but have quite a different odor from that of
the genuine tree. Great care must, therefore, be taken
in the collection of the leaves which are to be used, as
the admixture of a small quantity of the other leaves
may entirely spoil the product of distillation. Two oils
are obtained, a light oil of specific gravity of 0.870 to
0.990, and a heavy oil with specific gravity 1.023 to
1.037. When first distilled the oil is colorless, but by
exposure to the air quickly acquires a yellowish tint and,
if the exposure be continued, becomes quite dark in color.
The odor of the freshly-distilled oil is rank, but in the
course of from three to six months it becomes mellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and ripens into the agreeable fragrance so much liked in
the best specimens of bay-rum. The oil is soluble in
all proportions in 95 per cent. alcohol, also in ether and
petroleum benzine. Its chief use is for the preparation
of bay-rum.</p>

<p><i>Bergamot oil</i> is obtained from the rinds of the fruit of
<i>citrus bergamia</i>, a tree belonging to the natural order
<i>Aurantiaceæ</i>. The rind is grated and the oil running
off separated from the aqueous fluid and cellular substance
by means of a separating funnel, or the grated
mass is distilled in a current of carbonic acid. The oil
is very fluid and pale yellow, but poorer qualities are frequently
greenish or brownish. When distilled with
water it becomes perfectly colorless, but is less durable.
Its odor is very pleasant, somewhat like a mixture of
orange and lemon oils. Its specific gravity is 0.87 to
0.89. By standing for some time, the oil separates
white crystalline scales (stearoptene), which melt at 223°
F. The oil becomes solid a few degrees below the freezing
point. The Messina oil of bergamot is considered
the best. From other volatile oils of the orange family,
bergamot oil differs in dissolving readily in caustic potash,
forming a clear solution. It has, however, the same
property as other oils of a similar origin, of igniting
with iodine and not dissolving santalin, the red resinous
coloring matter of santal-wood.</p>

<p>Bergamot oil may be tested as to its purity by mixing
it with alcohol. It becomes pale gray-yellow, forms a
sediment which adheres firmly to the vessel and, on
shaking, floats about in the form of flakes. After two
days the sediment is inconsiderable and difficult to
divide into flakes in the clear yellow fluid by shaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
The oil is frequently adulterated with alcohol. To
detect such adulteration, Righini recommends the following
method: Mix 15 parts of the oil with a like quantity
of pure olive oil or oil of sweet almonds. If
alcohol is present, it immediately separates, like water,
from the fat oil; if no separation takes place the oil is
not adulterated with alcohol. The tannin test also gives
reliable results. In storing oil of bergamot great care
must be exercised to exclude air and light, as it is one
of the most changeable oils and soon acquires an odor
resembling that of turpentine.</p>

<p>Large quantities of oil of bergamot are used in perfumery.
It forms, so to say, the basis for most of the
finer products. In Cologne water it forms the principal
constituent in the mixture of volatile oils.</p>

<p><i>Cajeput oil</i> (<i>oleum cajeputi</i>).&mdash;This oil is obtained by
distillation from the leaves of several species of <i>Melaleucæ</i>,
natural order <i>Caryophyllaceæ</i>, indigenous to the East
Indies, Banda, and Malabar. The ordinary oil has a
greenish color and possesses a strong odor of camphor
and a pungent taste. It is chiefly imported by way of
Amsterdam, where it is partially discolored by rectification,
so that two kinds, the white and green cajeput
oil, are brought into commerce. The color of the latter
is generally supposed to be due to a resinous substance
containing chlorophyl, though others assert that it originates
from the copper of the distilling apparatus and the
copper flasks in which it is dispatched. The specific
gravity of the oil varies between 0.910 and 0.940,
though specifically lighter and heavier oils are said to
occur.</p>

<p>It is claimed that an artificial cajeput oil is often pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>pared
from camphor and rosemary oil, the green color
being obtained by distillation with milfoil. The
presence of camphor may be readily determined by
thoroughly triturating a few drops of the oil with sugar
and then dissolving in water, whereby the particles of
camphor separate in the form of white flakes upon the
surface.</p>

<p>Cajeput oil is frequently adulterated with oil of turpentine
and rosemary oil. Such adulteration is recognized
by pure cajeput oil dissolving clear in equal parts
of 90 per cent. alcohol, which is not the case with the
other two oils.</p>

<p><i>Camomile or chamomile oil</i> (<i>oleum anthemidis</i>).&mdash;Two
varieties of oil of camomile are found in commerce, one
green and the other blue. The first is derived from the
flowers of the genuine or Roman camomile (<i>Anthemis
nobilis</i>) and the blue from the common variety (<i>Matricaria
chamomila</i>). The last oil is the one chiefly used
in the manufacture of perfumery and in medicine.</p>

<p><i>Blue camomile oil</i> is generally obtained by distillation.
In distilling, metal Florentine flasks should be used, as
the oil adheres tenaciously to glass vessels and the distillate
has to be treated with ether. The pure oil has a
beautiful blue color, and on heating forms blue vapors.
It has a penetrating odor which only by strong dilution
becomes similar to that of camomile. By storing in
the light and the simultaneous presence of air, the oil
turns green; later on, brown, and is finally converted
into a thickly-fluid, brownish mass.</p>

<p><i>Green camomile oil</i> from the genuine or Roman camomile
possesses an agreeable odor of fresh lemons; it is
more seldom used than the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>On account of the slight yield obtained from the
flowers, camomile oil is rather expensive.</p>

<p><i>Caraway oil</i> (<i>oleum carui</i>) is obtained by distillation
from the seeds of the well-known aromatic plant <i>Carum
carui</i>, or the caraway, natural order <i>Umbelliferæ</i>. In a
fresh, purified state the oil is colorless, very thinly-fluid
and possesses a pungent taste. The oil prepared from
cleansed Dutch seed is best liked, while that distilled
from Norwegian or Tyrolese seed is not much in demand,
its taste and odor not being so pure on account of the
many impurities mixed with these kinds of seed.</p>

<p>Caraway oil consists mainly of a terpene, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>,
called <i>carvene</i>, specific gravity 0.870, and of <i>carvol</i>, specific
gravity 0.960. The richer the oil in carvol, the
higher its specific gravity. Good caraway oil should
have a specific gravity of 0.900 to 0.910. The carvol
being the actual bearer of the aroma, the value of the
oil exclusively depends on the content of it. In the
better varieties of oil, the content of carvol amounts to
from 45 to 50 per cent., while poorer qualities generally
contain only from 40 to 42 per cent. The carvol and
carvene are now frequently separated by fractional distillation.
The carvol, which has three times as strong
an odor and taste as the carvene, dissolves with much
greater facility in alcohol. The carvene being offered
at very low prices might be suitable for perfuming cheap
soaps.</p>

<p>Caraway oil obtained by distillation from the plant
has a less agreeable odor than that from the seed, and
possesses an acrid resinous taste.</p>

<p>The purity of caraway oil is recognized by its dissolving
clear in equal parts of 90 per cent. alcohol. If such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
is not the case, the oil contains either an admixture of
oil of turpentine or does not possess the full normal
content of carvol. Pure caraway oil does not detonate
with iodine, which is the case with oil containing oil of
turpentine.</p>

<p>Caraway oil is chiefly used for perfuming soap; for
handkerchief perfumes it is not suitable.</p>

<p><i>Cedar oil</i> (<i>oleum cedri</i>) is obtained by distillation from
the shavings of the wood of the American or Virginia
cedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>). For the distillation of oil
the waste falling off in the manufacture of lead-pencils
is almost exclusively used. It yields about 2 to 3 per
cent. of oil. The oil is thinly-fluid, of specific gravity
0.9622, of a greenish color, and an agreeable but not
very penetrating odor. It is a mixture of a terpene,
boiling at about 540° F., and of a hydrocarbon. The
latter, which is called <i>cidrin</i>, forms the fluid portion of
the oil. It has a specific gravity of 0.984, and boils
at about 459° F.</p>

<p>Cedar oil is extensively used in the manufacture of
toilet soap, it serving as the basis for other perfumes.
Care must, however, be taken that its odor does not
preponderate, as in such case it readily produces an unpleasant
effect. The oil being cheap, adulteration is
scarcely to be feared.</p>

<p>A volatile oil is also obtained by distillation from the
leaves of the <i>Juniperus virginiana</i>. In odor it resembles
savin oil, and is unfit for perfuming purposes.</p>

<p><i>Cherry-laurel oil</i> (<i>oleum laurocerasi</i>) is the volatile oil,
which contains prussic acid, obtained from the leaves of
the cherry-laurel (<i>Prunus laurocerasus, L.</i>). Like bitter
almonds, the leaves contain some amygdalin. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
they are macerated with water and allowed to stand in
a warm place for 24 hours. By subsequent distillation
a volatile oil is obtained which closely resembles oil of
bitter almonds, but differs in some respects. It is colorless
or yellowish, rarely reddish, and of specific gravity
1.05 to 1.06. In its behavior towards air, solvents, and
reagents, it does not essentially differ from oil of bitter
almonds.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>To detect oil of mirbane in cherry-laurel oil, Enrico
Pega adds some alcohol to the oil to be tested and then
mixes it with some alcoholic potash lye and a few drops
of ferric chloride solution. After standing for a few
hours the mixture is shaken and distilled. A small
portion of the oil distilling over is freed from water,
poured upon a few small pieces of pure caustic potash
in a test-tube, and heated over a lamp. If the sample
is pure it remains colorless; in the presence of oil of
mirbane it acquires a dark coloration in consequence of
the formation of nitrobenzide and aniline, a few drops
of calcium chloride solution brought into the mixture
producing, for this reason, a violet coloration.</p>

<p>Cherry laurel oil is but seldom used for perfuming
purposes.</p>

<p><i>Cinnamon oils.</i>&mdash;There are four different kinds of this
oil, viz., <i>Ceylon cinnamon oil</i>, <i>cassia oil</i>, <i>cinnamon root
oil</i>, and <i>oil of cinnamon leaves</i>. Though the first two
are very much alike, the Ceylon oil is considered the
best.</p>

<p><i>Ceylon cinnamon oil</i> (<i>oleum cinnamoni ceylonici</i>).&mdash;Formerly
this oil was exclusively distilled from chips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and waste of the genuine cinnamon bark of the <i>Cinnamonum
ceylonicum, Nees</i>, and came into commerce from
Ceylon. However, the fabrication of the oil from cinnamon
waste or chips is now extensively carried on in
Germany, and this oil, being prepared with the assistance
of more perfect apparatus, has almost entirely supplanted
that exported from Ceylon.</p>

<p>When fresh, the Ceylon oil is colorless, but when
stored for some time it becomes first golden yellow and
later on brownish. It is thickly-fluid and heavier than
water, its specific gravity being 1.060 to 1.090. It has
an agreeable, aromatic odor and a biting but pure, sweet
taste. Its principal constituent is cinnamaldehyde
(C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O), and it contains, besides, 4 to 8 per cent. of
eugenol. The presence of the latter in cinnamon oil
may be established by shaking with 15 per cent. soda-solution,
whereby the eugenol is dissolved, and decomposing
the aqueous solution with hydrochloric acid.
The eugenol separated thereby gives in alcoholic solution,
when compounded with a trace of ferric chloride,
a beautiful blue color.</p>

<p><i>Cassia oil</i> (<i>oleum cassiæ</i>).&mdash;In China and Cochin China
this oil is obtained by distillation from the bark, unripe
fruits, buds, and other waste of the <i>Cinnamonum cassia</i>
or <i>Cinnamonum aromaticum, Nees</i>, a tree indigenous to
those countries. It has a pale yellow color, which in
time becomes brown. It is thickly-fluid, of specific
gravity 1.05 to 1.07, and possesses a sweet taste with
an acrid after-taste. Like cinnamon oil, it consists
chiefly of cinnamaldehyde, but contains no eugenol, and
hence can be readily distinguished from Ceylon oil by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the above-mentioned reaction. One part of pure cassia
oil dissolves in two parts of 80 per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Cinnamon root oil and oil of cinnamon leaves.</i>&mdash;Neither
of these oils contains cinnamaldehyde, but abundant
quantities of eugenol, the root oil as much as 50 to 70
per cent. The root oil is quite limpid and has an
agreeable odor of cinnamon and cloves. The leaf oil
is thickly-fluid, of the consistency of castor oil.</p>

<p>The Ceylon oil is frequently adulterated with cassia
oil. Such adulteration is very difficult to detect, and
can only be recognized by experts by the odor and taste.</p>

<p>The quality of cassia oil is recognized by the taste and
odor, especially on heating, and the high specific gravity,
in consequence of which the oil sinks in water. According
to Hager, cassia oil is frequently adulterated with
oil of cloves. This is, however, scarcely probable, the
price of oil of cloves being, on an average, higher than
that of cassia oil. The latter, however, is frequently
adulterated with cheaper thickly-fluid volatile oils, especially
with cedar oil. In this case the oil does not
dissolve in the above-mentioned proportion in alcohol.</p>

<p>The value of cassia oil is dependent on its contents
of cinnamaldehyde. Hence, the establishment of its
actual value requires a quantitative determination of its
contents of cinnamaldehyde, which unfortunately presents
great difficulties. For this purpose Schimmel &amp;
Co. proceed indirectly as follows: 75 grammes of cassia
oil in a capacious boiling flask are mixed with 300
grammes of a boiling-hot 30 per cent. solution of acid
sodium sulphite, whereby cinnamaldehyde-sodium sulphite
is immediately separated. The whole is then
vigorously agitated and allowed to rest for a short time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
(With oils rich in aldehyde considerable heating generally
takes place, which must eventually be moderated
by the addition of cold water.) Next add about 200
grammes of hot water and heat the whole, with frequent
shaking, in the water-bath until the combination of the
aldehyde with the acid-sodium sulphite is <i>completely</i>
dissolved, and the non-aldehydes in the form of an oily
layer float upon the solution of the aldehyde salt. Now
allow the whole to cool, then shake twice with ether;
first, with about 200 cubic centimeters, and then with
100; combine the ethereal extracts of the non-aldehydes
separated by means of a separatory funnel, and filter
them into a capacious, previously-weighed beaker provided
with a platinum wire, the lower end of which is
bent in the form of a spiral. Now evaporate the ether
as much as possible, by placing the beaker in hot water.
When by swinging the beaker the remaining fluid no
longer foams up, allow to cool off and weigh. Now
return the beaker-glass to the water-bath for ten minutes,
weigh again after cooling, and repeat the operation
until the difference between two weighings does not
amount to more than 0.3 gramme at the utmost. The
weighing <i>previous to the last</i> is taken as the correct one.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The weight of the non-aldehydes thus obtained is
deducted from the cassia oil used, the difference giving
the content of cinnamaldehyde in the latter.</p>

<p>By accurately following the directions given, the difference
between two controlling determinations will be
only a few tenths per cent., seldom as much as 1 per
cent. For practical purposes, for which alone this
method is intended, this is more than sufficient.</p>

<p>According to the reports of Schimmel &amp; Co., all the
cassia oil brought into commerce from China was for a
considerable time adulterated with resin and petroleum,
they having found as much as 30 per cent. of resin in
the oil. Such adulteration can be established by the
determination of the specific gravity and distilling the
oil. Good cassia oil should show a specific gravity of
1.05 to 1.07 at 59° F., and by distillation 90 per cent.
of pure cassia oil must pass over. The residue should
not solidify after cooling and acquire the character of a
brittle resin; it must remain at least thickly-fluid, and
under no conditions amount to more than 10 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Citron oil</i> (<i>oleum citri</i>), from the peel of the fruit of
<i>Citrus medica</i> or the citron tree. The oil is prepared in
a similar manner to that of oil of bergamot, either by
expression or distillation, the latter process yielding more
and purer oil.</p>

<p>Rectified citron oil is colorless, of an agreeable pene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>trating
odor and acrid taste, and very sensitive to light
and air. By exposure to light it turns yellow, and if air
be admitted at the same time, it is first converted into
a fluid which, on account of its content of ozone, possesses
strong bleaching powers. The oil at the same
time acquires a disagreeable odor, resembling that of
oil of turpentine, and is finally converted into a resinous
mass.</p>

<p>Citron oil is frequently adulterated with oil of orange
and sometimes with oil of bergamot. These adulterations
are readily detected by an experienced person by
the odor, this being in fact the best guide. The specific
gravity of citron oil is 0.850 at 59° F.; it boils at
from 332.6° to 343.4° F. and congeals at 4° F.</p>

<p><i>Citronella oil</i> (<i>oleum citronellæ</i>) is chiefly distilled in
Ceylon from the lemon grass, <i>Andropogon Nardus, L.</i>
It is quite limpid, of a greenish-yellow to brown color,
and has an odor resembling that of genuine citron oil.
Its specific gravity is 0.896 at 59° F., and it boils at
from 392° to 410° F. Of the various oils reaching the
market that with the trade-mark "Fisher" is most
in demand, it being distinguished by special purity.
Edward Kremers has found in citronella oil an aldehyde,
C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O, a terpene, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>, citronellol, which is
isomeric with borneol; further, acetic acid and valerianic
acid.</p>

<p>The Indian distillers, it is claimed, adulterate the
citronella oil with petroleum, an addition up to 25 per
cent. being not uncommon.</p>

<p>According to experiments by Schimmel &amp; Co., pure
citronella oil must give a clear solution, when 1 part
of the oil is vigorously shaken with 10 parts of 80 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
cent. alcohol. If, in executing the test, the kind of turbidity
is observed, and whether the portion insoluble
in alcohol separates, after standing, upon the surface or
on the bottom of the fluid, and further, if the above-mentioned
quantity of alcohol is not added at one time,
but at first only 1 or 2 parts of it, a conclusion may be
drawn as to the kind and quantity of the adulterant.</p>

<p>Petroleum causes a milky-white turbidity, while in
the presence of fat oil the mixture becomes turbid, but
not actually milky. As a rule, fat oil deposits, after
standing, on the bottom, while petroleum floats upon
the surface of the fluid. Citronella oil adulterated with
fat oil does not dissolve in 1 to 2 parts nor in 10 parts
of 80 per cent. alcohol, while oil adulterated with not
too large a quantity of petroleum, gives a clear solution
with 1 to 2 parts. The determination of the specific
gravity may also serve for the detection of adulterations.
This holds good, however, only for petroleum, which
reduces the specific gravity, an addition of fat oil producing
no deviation in this respect. The specific gravity
of the oil should not be below 0.895 at 59° F.</p>

<p>Citronella oil is much used for perfuming cheap hair
oils and toilet soaps; it is the chief constituent of all
perfumes for honey-soaps. In the American soap industry
it is extensively used, the yearly consumption
being estimated at 1&frac12; million ounces.</p>

<p><i>Cloves, oil of</i> (<i>oleum caryophylli</i>), is obtained by distillation
with steam, or by extraction from the cloves of
commerce, which are the dried unexpanded flower buds
of <i>Caryophyllus aromaticus, L.</i>, or the clove tree. Oil
of cloves, when fresh, is almost colorless, but on exposure
to air acquires a brownish coloration and a thickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fluid consistency. It has the aromatic taste and odor of
cloves, and a specific gravity of 1.300 to 1.065. It frequently
shows a slightly acid reaction, boils at 482° F.,
and congeals at 4° F. It is readily soluble in alcohol,
ether, and strong acetic acid. It consists of a terpene
(C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>) and eugenol (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the odor of the oil
being due to the latter. The terpene has a specific
gravity of 0.918, and in distilling passes over first (light
oil of cloves). The eugenol, when fresh, is colorless,
has the odor and taste of cloves, a specific gravity of
1.063 at 65° F., boils at 487.4° F., is insoluble in water
and glycerin, but soluble in alcohol, ether and glacial
acetic acid. Its alcoholic solution is colored magnificently
blue by ferric chloride. If in an alkaline solution
it is oxidized with potassium permanganate, vanillin
being formed.</p>

<p>An inferior quality of oil is obtained from the stems
of the clove buds. It dissolves with greater difficulty
than the oil prepared from the buds, and has a darker
red-brown color.</p>

<p>To test the value of oil of cloves, introduce, according
to Stohman, into a graduated glass cylinder 10 volumes
ether, 10 oil of cloves, and 30 of a 10-per cent. soda
solution. After vigorous shaking, the eugenol dissolves;
the increase in volume of the aqueous fluid is then proportional
to the quantity of eugenol present. For more
exact determinations, dissolve a weighed quantity of
oil, repeatedly shake the aqueous fluid with ether to remove
the terpene, then decompose the eugenol-sodium
with dilute sulphuric acid, dissolve the separated eugenol
in ether and weigh after evaporating the ethereal fluid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Good oil of cloves does not contain less than 80 per
cent. of eugenol, and frequently 90 per cent. or more.</p>

<p>Oil of cloves is chiefly adulterated with copaiba oil
and cedar oil. Such adulteration is recognized by the
oil not forming a clear solution in every proportion with
alcohol, as is the case with pure oil of cloves.</p>

<p>Oil of cloves is much used for perfuming purposes.</p>

<p><i>Eucalyptus oil</i> (<i>oleum eucalypti</i>) is obtained from the
leaves of various trees of the eucalyptus family. According
to Merk two kinds of oil must be strictly kept
apart: <i>oleum eucalypti</i> from the leaves of <i>eucalyptus
globulus</i> and <i>oleum eucalypti australe</i>, the former being
used in medicine, and the latter, which is considerably
cheaper, chiefly for perfuming purposes. However,
Piesse's opinion that eucalyptus oil, as far as its odor is
concerned, does not deserve to be classed among perfumes
is undoubtedly correct. It has an odor between
that of oil of turpentine and cajeput oil, and as long as
perfumery is the art of sweet odors, such oil cannot be
designated a perfume.</p>

<p>When not rectified, eucalyptus oil is mostly yellowish
or bluish. In a rectified state it is colorless, clear,
limpid, lighter than water, of a strong odor, and acrid
taste. The oil from <i>eucalyptus globulus</i> has a specific
gravity of 0.900 to 0.925, and dissolves in every proportion
in 90 per cent. alcohol. It is optically inactive
or turns the plane of polarization slightly to the right.
On standing with sodium it acquires a yellowish coloration,
and does not detonate with iodine. The oil from
<i>eucalyptus australe</i> has a specific gravity of 0.86 to 0.87,
and is but sparingly soluble in 90 per cent. alcohol, so
that even a solution prepared in the proportion of 1:15<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
is turbid. It turns the plane of polarization strongly to
the left; acquires, on standing with sodium, a red coloration,
and detonates with iodine.</p>

<p>Eucalyptus oil consists of eucalyptol and eucalyptene,
and perhaps other hydrocarbons. The content of the
first, on which depends the medicinal value of the oil,
varies very much in the oils from the different species
of eucalyptus, the oil from some species, it is said, containing
no eucalyptol whatever.</p>

<p>Eucalyptol (C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is limpid, colorless, turns the
plane of polarization, has a specific gravity of 0.905,
and boils at 347° F. Its vapor mixed with air has an
agreeable, refreshing taste, and its dilute solutions remind
one of roses. Eucalyptene (C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>18</sub>) has a specific
gravity of 0.836, and boils at 329° F.</p>

<p><i>Fennel oil</i> (<i>oleum fœniculi</i>) is derived by distillation
from the fruits of <i>Fœniculum vulgare, Gaertner</i>. Large
quantities of it are produced in Saxony, and also
in Galicea. It is quite colorless, limpid, of specific
gravity 0.940 to 0.970 and, with a full content of stearoptene,
possesses a nauseous sweet taste and odor. It
contains 60 to 70 per cent. of anethol and congeals at
from 41° to 50° F. to a crystalline mass. The leaves
of the plant also contain a volatile oil, which is, however,
less valued than the seed-oil.</p>

<p>Good fennel oil should dissolve clear in 1 to 2 parts
of 90 per cent. alcohol. Direct adulterations of this
oil do not occur, but the stearoptene is frequently withdrawn
by fractional distillation whereby the oil loses
much in value. Such oil freed from stearoptene does
not congeal, has a more bitter than sweet taste and does
not dissolve in the above-mentioned proportion in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>In perfumery fennel oil is but little used; sometimes
in connection with other volatile oils for perfuming
soaps.</p>

<p><i>Geranium oil</i>, <i>palmarosa oil</i>, <i>Turkish geranium oil</i> is
obtained from <i>Andropogon Pachnodes</i>. It is yellowish,
limpid, of specific gravity 0.890 at 59° F., possesses a
very agreeable rose-like odor resembling that of geranium
oils from <i>Pelargonium radula, Aiton</i>, and for
this reason is generally designated as Turkish geranium
oil. The odor of the oil is improved by shaking it with
water containing lemon juice, any content of copper
being thereby removed. The washed oil is then brought
into shallow dishes and exposed for two or three weeks
to the sun, whereby its odor becomes still more like that
of rose oil. The oil thus prepared is much used for
adulterating rose oil. Turkish geranium oil is also
much used for the adulteration of genuine geranium oil
and is itself adulterated with oil of turpentine. It is
extensively employed in perfumery, especially for perfuming
hair oils and pomades, and in conjunction with
geranium oils for rose soap.</p>

<p><i>East Indian geranium oil</i> is obtained, chiefly in the
Presidency of Bombay, from <i>Andropogon Schoenantus,
L.</i> It is greenish-yellow to yellow-brown, has a specific
gravity of 0.906 at 59° F., and consists mainly of
geraniol (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O). Its odor is rose-like, though modified
by a lemon-like odor. It is principally used for
perfuming cheaper articles.</p>

<p><i>French and African geranium oils</i> (<i>oleum geranii</i>) are
obtained by distillation with water from the leaves of
various species of pelargonium. Many different kinds
of this oil are found in commerce. The finest and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
expensive are the Spanish and French geranium oils, so-called
<i lang="fr">rosé</i>, which are distinguished by their fine odor,
closely resembling that of rose oil. They are derived
from <i>Pelargonium radula</i>, and are either yellowish,
brownish, or pale green, the brownish oils being preferred.
It congeals at 60.8° F. and turns the plane of
polarization to the right. Another good geranium oil is
the African, which is chiefly prepared in Algiers from
<i>Pelargonium roseum</i>, <i>Wildenow</i>, and <i>P. odoratissimum,
Aiton</i>. It closely resembles the French oil, but turns
the plane of polarization to the left.</p>

<p>French geranium oil is said to be frequently adulterated
with fat or copaiba oil; but geranium oil being
soluble in 70 per cent. alcohol, such adulterations are
readily detected. Add to 5 cubic centimeters of 70 per
cent. alcohol (specific gravity 0.890) at 59° to 62.5° F.,
10 drops of the oil, and shake. If a clear solution results
the oil is very likely unadulterated.</p>

<p>The so-called Turkish geranium oil is frequently
found mixed with cocoanut oil. To detect this, place
the oil in a test-tube in ice or a cold mixture for several
hours, whereby the cocoanut oil separates as a white
substance. Adulterations of upward to 20 per cent. are
said to frequently occur.</p>

<p>Reliable tests to detect an adulteration of the better
qualities of geranium oil with those of a lower grade
do not exist, the odor being the only guide.</p>

<p><i>Jasmine oil</i> or <i>oil of jessamine</i>, from the flowers of
<i>Jasminium officinale, L.</i>, and <i>J. grandiflorum</i>.&mdash;The oil
is exclusively obtained by the absorption process, and
is the most prized by the perfumer. It is, however, exceedingly
rare on account of the enormous cost of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
production. The extract of jasmine, the "essence de jasmine"
of the French manufactories, is a solution of the
oil, as obtained by extraction with lard or beef suet, in
strong spirit of wine. The odor of jasmine oil is so
peculiar that it is without comparison, and as such
cannot be imitated.</p>

<p><i>Juniper oil</i> (<i>oleum juniperi</i>) is obtained by distillation
from the fruits of <i>Juniperus communis, L.</i>, or juniper.
The berries used for the purpose should be fully grown
and fresh and bruised before being placed in the still.
Unripe berries yield a smaller quantity and an oil of
somewhat different properties than ripe berries. The
oil obtained by distillation with steam is colorless and
that by ordinary distillation yellowish, the former having
a specific gravity of 0.840 to 0.860 and the latter
of 0.850 to 0.900. It consists mainly of terpenes. By
standing, a stearoptene is separated, which crystallizes in
feathery needles from hot spirit of wine. The odor and
taste of juniper oil remind one at the same time of juniper
berries and oil of turpentine.</p>

<p>Juniper oil has a great tendency to thicken; it becomes
resinous, acid and thickly fluid, formic acid being
formed. It should be kept in well-closed bottles, and
protected from light. It is frequently adulterated with
oil of turpentine and juniper-wood oil. It may be tested
by its behavior towards alcohol, as well as by the taste.
A drop of the oil rubbed up with sugar, and shaken
with 500 grammes of water, should not impart an acrid
taste to the water. Juniper oil gives a clear solution
with &frac12; part absolute alcohol; by a larger quantity it is
rendered turbid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lavender oil</i> (<i>oleum lavandulæ</i>.)&mdash;Large quantities of
this oil are distilled in Southern France, in the neighborhood
of Grasse and Nimes, from the flowers of
<i>lavandula officinalis, Chaix</i>, which grows wild in that
region. It is limpid, colorless, or yellowish, has a strong
odor and a pungent, aromatic, somewhat bitter taste.
With 90 per cent. alcohol it mixes clear in every proportion,
boils at 320° F., and has a specific gravity of
0.876 to 0.905. It turns the plane of polarization to
the left.</p>

<p>The best French lavender oil, distilled from pure
flowers only, is brought into commerce under the name,
"Essence de Lavande Montblanc." It is distinguished
from all other kinds, in the preparation of which more
or less stems and leaves are used, by its extremely agreeable
odor.</p>

<p>Lavender is also extensively cultivated in Mitchan
and Hitchin, England, and used for the preparation
of an especially fine oil, the odor of which surpasses
even that of the best French product. It is, however,
comparatively expensive.</p>

<p>From the leaves and flowers of <i>lavandula spica</i> the
<i>spike oil</i> is obtained by distillation. It is colorless, or
yellow, and in odor approaches rosemary oil more than
lavender oil. Its boiling point, like that of lavender
oil, is at 366.8° F., and its specific gravity 0.96. Spike
oil turns the plane of polarization only slightly to the
left, the deviation scarcely ever exceeding 0.8°.</p>

<p>Lavender oils are very sensitive to light and air, they
becoming ozonized under their influence, and acquire an
odor like turpentine. Hence they must be kept in well-closed
vessels in a dark place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Oil of lavender is frequently adulterated, chiefly with
alcohol, fat oils, oil of turpentine, and spike oil. To
test the oil, mix a drop of it with 10 cubic centimeters
of warm water, and test the odor, which should be pure
and agreeably lavender-like. The taste of the vigorously
agitated water should be transiently bitter aromatic.
One volume of the oil should give a turbid mixture
with one volume of dilute alcohol (specific gravity
0.895), but a perfectly clear one with three volumes.
On shaking 0.5 cubic centimeter of the oil with a few
grains of rosaniline it remains uncolored, but, in the
presence of even a trace of alcohol, it acquires a red
coloration. By mixing in a graduated cylinder equal
volumes of the oil and distilled water, and shaking
vigorously, the oil, after the water has settled, shows a
decrease in volume if alcohol be present. The presence
of fat oil can be readily recognized by bringing a drop
of the oil to be tested upon filtering paper; a grease
stain is formed, which disappears neither at the ordinary
temperature nor by heating. Adulteration with
oil of turpentine is recognized by the boiling point, that
of oil of turpentine being 312.8° F., and that of oil of
lavender, as previously stated, 366.8° F.</p>

<p>Spike oil should mix clear with equal parts of 90 per
cent. alcohol; the contrary would indicate adulteration
with oil of turpentine.</p>

<p>For perfumery, lavender oil is of great importance,
it being much employed by itself, as well as mixed with
other oils.</p>

<p><i>Lemon oil</i> (<i>oleum limonis</i>) is obtained by various processes
from the rinds of lemons. The best and most
delicately-scented oil is obtained by the so-called sponge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
process in use in Southern Italy and Sicily. The rinds
are soaked from fifteen to twenty-five minutes in water,
to which sometimes a little soda is added. They are
taken up singly in the right hand and the outer surface
of each is firmly pressed against a large and rather
hard-grained sponge held in the left hand and secured
by a strap. Two or three sharp turns of the wrist impart
what may be called a screw-pressure to the rind,
thus effectually fracturing the oil cells, the sponge absorbing
the contents. The sponge is constantly held
over an earthen jar and occasionally squeezed into it.
The fluid in the jar quickly separates into three different
products&mdash;the dregs or deposit of mucilaginous and
cellular matter, some fruit juice, and the pure oil, which
floats on the top. The latter, when bright and clear, is
passed, by means of a small glass siphon, into the cans
of thin copper, in which, after sealing, it is stored
away for export.</p>

<p>The above described primitive mode of fabrication
furnishes the most highly prized oils of commerce; they
are called hand-pressed oils or <i lang="fr">essences preparées a
l'éponge</i>. In the same manner are obtained the oils from
the sweet and bitter pomegranate, the bergamotte, and
mandarin orange.</p>

<p>Another method of expressing the oil is that of the
<i lang="fr">écuelle à piquer</i>, much used in the region about Nice.
The oils obtained by this method, which are also of a
very fine quality, are marked <i lang="fr">essence à l'écuelle</i> or <i lang="fr">au
zeste</i>. The apparatus consists of a round shallow pan
of copper or brass, having a receptacle for the oil at its
lowest part and a lip on one side for pouring, and
studded on its concavity by strong blunt spikes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
workman takes the fruit and rolls it gently but quickly
around the inside of the <i lang="fr">écuelle</i>; the spikes prick the
oil sacs, whereupon the oil, running down the spikes and
the concavity of the pan, collects in the reservoir at the
lowest part. The oil is filtered and then poured into
clean glass bottles, in which the impurities are allowed
to settle.</p>

<p>In Reggio, where especially much bergamot oil is
manufactured, sheet-metal bowl-like vessels, studded
inside with sharp ribs, are used. Six to eight fruits are
placed in the vessel. A movable lid closes the vessel,
so that there is just enough space for the fruits between
the lid and the bottom of the vessel. If now the lid be
revolved by hand-or steam-power, the rinds of the fruit
are torn apart, and the oil together with the juice runs
through the sieve-bottom of the apparatus into a cylindrical
vessel where it clarifies.</p>

<p>The third method of obtaining the oil is by <i>expression</i>.
The grated rind is placed in hair mats, and subjected to
powerful pressure by means of a screw or lever press.</p>

<p>The process of <i>distillation</i> is carried on as follows:
The peels, which should be from select fruit, are sprinkled
with powdered salt, and a few hours afterwards sufficient
water to moisten them is poured over them. A day or
two afterwards more water is added, and the whole is
distilled until either no more oil separates or the steam,
at first purely fragrant, begins to acquire a rank and
rather unpleasant smell. The oil obtained by distillation
is inferior to the others.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 20.</div>
<img src="images/fig_20.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Lately a combination of the écuelle and distilling processes
has been introduced by Domenico Monfalcone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
which has given excellent results. It is shown in Fig.
20. <i>F F</i> is a hollow cylinder, of sheet-iron, the interior
surface of which is studded with a large number of
small metallic knife-points. This cylinder revolves on
two axles attached to it at diagonally opposite points.
The cylinder having been half-charged with lemons,
together with a small quantity of water, is set in motion
by aid of the shafting and pulleys driven by the small
steam engine. The fruits are thereby made to come in
contact with the metallic lancets, and their whole surface
gradually becomes punctured sufficiently to rupture the
cells containing the volatile oil, which escapes. The
cylinder <i>F F</i> has double walls, the space between them
being intended for the circulation of a current of steam,
which is admitted to heat the water and to facilitate the
extraction of the oil, while at the same time the vapors are
rarefied or aspirated by the vacuum pump <i>L</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
axles of the cylinder on both sides are hollow; that on
the side looking towards the engine is imbedded in
such a manner that steam from the boiler <i>D</i> may be admitted
at will, either into the double walls of the cylinder,
or into the interior of the cylinder itself, while
the hollow passage in the other axle communicates with
a condensing worm, <i>G</i>, the outlet of which, <i>H</i>, descends
into a cylindrical vessel, <i>I</i>, intended to receive the condensed
products, consisting of water and volatile oil.
When the apparatus is first set in motion the pump <i>L</i>
begins to produce a vacuum during the first revolutions
of the cylinder. Steam being now cautiously admitted
into the double walls of the cylinder, the water is raised
to boiling at a comparatively low temperature, and the
vapors charged with the volatile oil pass over into the
receptacle, where they separate into two layers. The
product obtained by this process is claimed to be equal
in quality to that obtained by mechanical means, and
the yield nearly double.</p>

<p>During the months of November to March the average
yield from 1000 lemons in the factories of Palermo is
320 grammes of oil; in those of Messina, where a better
quality of fruit is employed, the yield is about 400
grammes. The same number of lemons yield about
10 gallons of juice, the collection of which is, of course,
a necessary accompaniment of the manufacture of volatile
oil.</p>

<p>Pure oil of lemons is almost colorless and has the
odor of the fruit. Its specific gravity varies between
0.8752 and 0.8785; it boils at 298.4° F., and is soluble
in all proportions in absolute alcohol and glacial acetic
acid. It contains, according to G. Bouchardat and J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Lafont, besides a little cymene, several hydrocarbons, the
most abundant of which is citrene, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>, boiling near
352.5° F., having a rotatory power exceeding +105°,
and yielding a solid optically inactive dihydrochloride.</p>

<p>Oil of lemons is frequently adulterated with oil of turpentine.
This may be detected, according to G. Heppe,
by slowly heating the oil in a dry test-tube with a small
piece of copper butyrate to about 338° F., taking care
that the temperature does not exceed 356°F. The copper
salt will dissolve in pure oil of lemons with a green color,
while in the presence of oil of turpentine a yellow turbid
mixture is obtained, reddish-yellow cuprous oxide being
separated. This test is also applicable to oils of bergamot
and of orange-peel.</p>

<p><i>Lilac oil</i> is obtained from the flowers of <i>Syringa vulgaris</i>,
the lilac, by aqueous distillation and subsequent
extraction with benzine. It is also frequently prepared
by the absorption process. It is used for the most expensive
perfumes, and is seldom found in commerce.</p>

<p><i>Limes, oil of</i> (<i>oleum limettæ</i>), is derived from the rind
of the fruit of <i>Citrus limetta</i>, or lime. The oil is obtained
in the same manner as oil of lemons, which it
somewhat resembles. Its mean specific gravity is 0.8734
at 84° F. The oil made by the écuelle process is of a
decidedly yellow color, varying in intensity, being darker
in the fresh product. The difference in flavor and aroma
is so marked as scarcely to require any other means of
distinguishing the oil made by the écuelle process from
that obtained by distillation, the first having a decided
fragrant lemon smell, whilst the distilled oil is very inferior,
frequently possessing little more than the smell
of turpentine. Large quantities of oil of limes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
manufactured in Dominica, but most of the oil exported
from there is of an inferior quality and was
formerly solely used for adulterating oil of lemons.
Lately it has also been employed for scenting soaps and
in the manufacture of the common essences and perfumes.</p>

<p><i>Licari oil, linaloë oil</i>, is obtained, partially in Mexico
and partially in Cayenne, from the wood of the white
cedar (<i lang="fr">bois de rose femelle</i>), <i>Licari canali</i>. It is limpid,
has an agreeable odor, reminding one of roses, and does
not become solid at 4° F. Its specific gravity is 0.868
at 59° F., and it boils at 388.4° F.</p>

<p><i>Marjoram oils.</i>&mdash;By distilling the leaves of <i>Origanum
marjorana, L.</i>, the <i>marjoram oil</i> (<i>oleum marjoranæ</i>) is obtained.
It is yellowish or green-yellowish, but becomes
reddish-brown by age. If badly kept it finally becomes
thickly-fluid and sticky, sometimes depositing a reddish
stearoptene. The odor of marjoram oil is less agreeable
than that of the plant, and the taste peculiar, bitter,
cooling. The oil dissolves readily in 90 per cent.
alcohol, and when mixed with equal parts of it yields a
clear solution. Its specific gravity is 0.89 to 0.91. It
should be kept in entirely filled, well-closed bottles in a
shady place. On coming in contact with air, it absorbs
oxygen with avidity and forms a white, odorless, crystalline
mass.</p>

<p>From <i>Origanum vulgare, L.</i>, the ordinary marjoram
oil (<i>oleum origani vulgaris</i>) is obtained. It is yellowish
or reddish, limpid, of specific gravity 0.90 to 0.95, and
has a camphor-like odor.</p>

<p><i>Spanish marjoram</i> (<i>oleum origani cretici</i>) is obtained
by distillation from the flowering plants of several
varieties of marjoram (<i>Or. creticum</i>, <i>Or. hirtum</i>, <i>Or.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
smyrnæum</i>). It is brought into commerce from Trieste,
Smyrna, Salonica, and other Mediterranean seaports.
The oil exported from France appears to be derived
from another variety of marjoram; at least it shows a
different behavior and approaches more the ordinary
marjoram oil. The genuine oil is thickly-fluid, generally
yellow-brown; of specific gravity O.95 to O.97; has a
strong, aromatic odor, and produces upon the tongue a
sharp continued burning. It dissolves in equal parts of
90 per cent. alcohol. It is chiefly adulterated with
copaiba oil, the presence of which can be recognized by
the oil dissolving with greater difficulty.</p>

<p>The marjoram oils are but little used for perfuming
purposes.</p>

<p><i>Mignonette oil</i> (<i>oleum résédæ</i>). The well-known
mignonette, <i>Réséda odoratissima</i>, yields a thick yellowish
oil, either by maceration and absorption, or by
extraction with ether or petroleum-ether. It has a penetrating,
disagreeable odor, which can only be rendered
agreeable by greatly diluting the oil. In gathering
the flowers care must be had not to mix them with
leaves, as this spoils the odor of the oil.</p>

<p><i>Myrrh oil</i> (<i>oleum myrthæ</i>) is obtained from the leaves
of <i>Myrtus communis, L.</i> It is yellowish, dextrorotatory,
of specific gravity 0.910 at 60.8° F., and commences to
boil at 320° F. As its principal constituents, Jahns
has established a terpene (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>), boiling at from 316.4°
to 320° F., and turning the plane of polarization to
the right, and cineol (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O), which boils at 348.8°
F. Besides these principal constituents there seems to
be present a very small quantity of a camphor, corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>very likely to the formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O. Myrtol, which
was formerly supposed to exist in myrtle oil, has been
found to be a mixture of the dextrorotatory terpene and
of cineol.</p>

<p><i>Nutmeg oils.</i>&mdash;From mace, the fresh aril of the
nutmeg (<i>Myristica fragrans, Houtt</i>, natural order
<i>Myristicaceæ</i>), <i>mace oil</i> (<i>oleum macidis</i>), is obtained by
distillation. It is straw-yellow or yellowish, later on
yellow-reddish, clear, somewhat thickly-fluid, of a strong
odor resembling that of mace, and a taste at first mild,
but later on pungent and aromatic. It mixes clear in
every proportion with absolute alcohol, but of 90 per
cent. alcohol, 5 to 6 volumes are required for a clear
solution. The specific gravity of the oil varies from
0.87 to 0.92. With iodine it detonates, vapors being
emitted. The oil obtained from dried mace has a less
agreeable odor.</p>

<p>The oil is frequently adulterated with tincture of nutmeg
prepared with absolute alcohol. Such an adulteration,
as well as any content of alcohol, is recognized by
shaking 0.5 cubic centimeter of the oil with a grain of
rosaniline. In the presence of alcohol the oil acquires
a red coloration, while pure oil remains uncolored.</p>

<p>From the nutmegs, the seed of <i>Myristica fragrans</i>,
freed from the seed-coat and aril, a volatile oil
(<i>oleum nucistæ æthereum</i>) is also obtained by distillation.
It is generally yellowish, seldom colorless, somewhat
thickly-fluid and has the odor and taste of nutmegs. It
is readily soluble in alcohol and ether and of specific
gravity, 0.93 to 0.95. It consists of two oils, one specifically
lighter and fluid, and the other heavy and crystalline.
On standing it deposits a stearoptene, called
myristicin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The nutmeg oils are but seldom used in perfumery.</p>

<p><i>Opopanax oil</i> is obtained from opopanax.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is of
gold-yellow color and an agreeable balsamic odor reminding
one somewhat of myrrh. Its specific gravity is
0.9016, and it boils between 392° and 572° F.</p>

<p>On account of its strength, the oil must be very carefully
handled in perfuming, but if used in the correct
proportion it is very advantageous.</p>

<p><i>Orange-peel oil</i>, also called <i>Portugal oil</i> or <i>essence of
Portugal</i>, is obtained in Italy from the fresh peels of the
orange, the fruit of <i>Citrus vulgaris, Risso</i>. It is prepared
in a manner similar to that of oil of lemons (which
see). In commerce a distinction is made between the
Messina oil, which is of inferior quality, and the Calabria
oil, which is of a better quality. The Messina oil has a
yellow color, frequently not much darker than that of
oil of lemons, while the color of Calabria oil is dark yellow,
nearly brown. The oil prepared from the peels of
the bitter orange (<i>Citrus bigaradia, Duhamel</i>), is of
the same color as the sweet Messina oil. It is more used
in the preparation of liqueurs than for perfuming.
Orange-peel oils are limpid and have a specific gravity
of 0.819 to 0.9. One part of orange-peel oil should, according
to its age, dissolve clear in 5 to 10 parts of 90
per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p>Very similar to orange-peel oil, though differing
somewhat in odor, is the <i>mandarin oil</i> obtained from
the fresh peels of the mandarin orange, the fruit of
<i>Citrus sinensis</i>. It is brought into commerce from
Reggio and is said to form a constituent of the genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
<i>ess-bouquet</i>. It has a specific gravity of 0.852 at 50° F.
and is dextrorotatory.</p>

<p>While from the peels the volatile oil is but seldom
obtained by distillation, this process is exclusively used
for gaining volatile oils from the flowers, leaves, and
young branches. In this connection two kinds of volatile
oil have chiefly to be considered, viz: <i>orange-flower
oil</i> and <i>petit-grain oil</i>.</p>

<p><i>Orange-flower oil</i> or <i>neroli oil</i> (<i>oleum florum aurantii</i>;
<i>ol. neroli</i>; <i>ol. naphæ</i>) is obtained by distillation from the
flowers of the bitter orange; while the flowers of the
sweet orange yield the so-called <i>neroli-Portugal oil</i>, which
is far inferior to the other.</p>

<p>On the French Riviera, the orange is especially cultivated
for obtaining blossoms and leaves for distilling
purposes. At Cannes, Le Cannet, Golfe-Juan, Vallauris,
Biot, Vence, Le Bar, Antibes, Le Cap, Nice,
and Mentone, the bitter orange, whose flowers are
very numerous and especially suitable for perfumery, is
chiefly cultivated. Cannes and Le Cannet alone possess
150,000 to 160,000 such trees, and Golfe-Juan
and Vallauris 200,000. The flowers harvested in
Golfe-Juan amount to about 700,000 lbs., in Le Cannet
to about 330,000 lbs., at Cannes to about 130,000 lbs.,
and in Antibes, Mentone, and Nice to about 260,000 lbs.
One orange tree yields, according to its age, from 2 to
17 lbs. of flowers. The distillation of neroli oil has
also been lately commenced in Sicily and Calabria, but
as far as quality is concerned, the oil thus far brought
into commerce cannot compete with the French oil.</p>

<p>Oil of orange flowers is at first nearly colorless or
straw-yellow, but becomes reddish-yellow when kept for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
some time. In a clear glass it opalizes bluish. It is
limpid and has a slightly bitter taste and a strong but
very delicious odor. Its specific gravity varies between
0.85 and 0.90. It is but sparingly soluble in water,
but imparts to the latter an agreeable odor; the solution
is colored red by sulphuric acid. With 1 to 2 parts
of 90 per cent. alcohol, the oil gives a clear solution
which becomes turbid by a further addition of alcohol
and, after standing quietly, a flaky separation of stearoptene
is observed. If not carefully kept the oil becomes
darker and even acquires a disagreeable odor. By rectification
with water oil thus spoiled can be restored.
With sodium the oil does not evolve hydrogen gas; it
detonates with iodine.</p>

<p>Of the various oils of orange blossoms occurring in
commerce "<i>Neroli petale</i>" is the best.</p>

<p>Neroli oil being a very expensive oil is exposed to
many adulterations. Mierzinski even asserts that no
genuine unadulterated neroli oil occurs in commerce, because
it is a well-known fact that what is sold as genuine,
pure neroli oil, consists on an average of 4/8 genuine neroli
oil, 1/8 oil of bergamot, and 3/8 petit-grain oil. Furthermore,
it is no secret that besides the flowers of all kinds
of <i>Aurantiaceæ</i>, unripe fruits or fresh peels of ripe fruits
and even young shoots of the branches and leaves are
subjected to distillation. This assertion perhaps goes
too far, but nevertheless it is advisable to procure the
oil only from a thoroughly reliable firm.</p>

<p>A very frequent adulteration consists in an addition
of petit-grain oil. Such an addition can only be recognized
by the taste and odor. For this purpose add to
3 drops of oil in a small bottle 10 grammes of distilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
water, and, after shaking vigorously, test as to the odor
and taste. According to Chevalier, pour 1 or 2 drops
of the oil upon sugar and stir the latter in water; if the
oil is not genuine the water acquires a bitter taste.
Hager recommends the following test: Mix 3 drops of
the oil in a test-tube with 40 to 50 drops of alcohol; add,
after complete solution, about ⅓ the volume of the solution
of concentrated sulphuric acid, and effect mixture
by careful shaking. Pure oil gives a turbid, reddish,
dark-brown mixture (with old oil, dark brown); almost
all other oils, which may be substituted, give paler-colored
(reddish, red, or ocher-color) mixtures; or, in case the
genuine oil is adulterated with non-genuine, the mixture
exhibits a considerably less dark-color. When this test
has been several times executed with genuine oil, no
room for doubt is left. If the mixture be diluted with
four times its volume of water, it becomes yellowish and
milky.</p>

<p>The odor of orange flowers is, according to Soubeiran,
due to two volatile oils, of which the one having the
most delicious odor is soluble in water. The other
volatile oil, of which the neroli oil of commerce chiefly
consists, is sparingly soluble in water, and does not possess
such a delicious odor. This is the reason why good
orange-flower water cannot be prepared by saturating
water with neroli oil. The genuine orange-flower water
is obtained as a by-product in distilling the oil.</p>

<p>Neroli oil is much used for the finer perfumes, it being
especially a necessary constituent of <i lang="fr">eau de Cologne</i>. It
has to be carefully protected from air and light. For
perfuming purposes it is only sufficiently ripe after
having been stored for at least one year. If, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
it becomes too old, it inclines towards rancidity, which
may be prevented by compounding it with an equal
volume of fine spirit. Portugal oil being of inferior
quality can only be used for lower grade products.</p>

<p><i>Petit grain oil</i> (<i>oleum petit grain</i>) is obtained by distillation
from the leaves, young shoots and unripe fruits
of different <i>Aurantiaceæ</i>. The best oil is that distilled
from the leaves of the bitter orange, it possessing an odor
similar to that of neroli oil, but, of course, not so fine.
Southern France was formerly the chief place for the
production of this oil, but considerable quantities of it
are now manufactured in Paraguay, and the oil at present
brought from there into commerce being of quite a
good quality and considerably cheaper than the French
oil, has almost entirely supplanted the latter.</p>

<p><i>Orris root, oil of</i> (<i>oleum iridis</i>), is obtained by distillation
with steam from the rhizomes of <i>Iris florentina</i>,
which is cultivated in Southern France, Dalmatia, and
other regions. It has a yellow color and, at an ordinary
temperature, a quite solid consistency like butter
or wax, so that it can be rendered fluid only by heating.
It consists chiefly of a rigid odorless body to which
the liquid odoriferous oil adheres. The solid portion
was formerly designated orris-stearoptene; according to
Flueckiger it is, however, myristic acid.</p>

<p>Oil of orris root is one of the oils which keep for
years without suffering injury. It is recommended to
keep it in stock in alcoholic solution so that the myristic
acid contained in it may to a certain degree be etherized,
and cannot injuriously affect the odoriferous principle.</p>

<p>Oil of orris root serves as a substitute and for
strengthening the natural odor of violets. It can, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>ever,
be employed only for very fine expensive perfumery
since, on account of the very slight yield from the
root (from 1000 parts &frac12; to &frac34; part of oil), its price is
very high, generally exceeding that of rose oil.</p>

<p>An admixture of other volatile oils of less value
would render the oil fluid at the ordinary temperature.</p>

<p><i>Patchouli oil.</i>&mdash;By the name of patchouli are known,
according to L. Wray, Jr., the leaves of <i>Pogostemon
patchouli, Pellet</i>, natural order <i>Labiatæ</i>, indigenous to
the East Indies, and known and used for centuries in
the various regions of China, Assam, and the Malayan
Islands. Most of the patchouli comes from the East
Indies. Before exportation it is sorted into three qualities:
1. <i>Selected</i>, consisting of leaves only. 2. <i>Mixed</i>,
leaves with slight peduncles and few stems. 3. <i>Stalky
leaves.</i> The best quality occurs seldom in commerce since
the picking of the leaves does not cover the expense.</p>

<p>According to Wray, the leaves are intentionally mixed
with those of the <i>ruku</i> (<i>ocimum basilicum, L.</i>), an herb
indigenous to the Malayan Islands. The leaves of the
latter are broader than those of <i>pogostemon patchouli</i>,
and the stalks thinner and round. Seed-capsules are
also frequently found among the leaves, though patchouli
seldom flowers and bears seeds.</p>

<p>In Europe, patchouli has been an article of commerce
since 1841. In the Orient it is highly esteemed as a
perfume. The Arabs even ascribe remedial properties
to it, and it is customary with them to fill their pillows
with the leaves to protect them from infection and prolong
their lives.</p>

<p>The peculiar, penetrating, though not exactly agreeable,
odor of patchouli leaves, is due to a volatile oil, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
which they contain 1.5 to 2 per cent. In the Orient
this oil has for many years been obtained by distillation.</p>

<p>In the Penang market two kinds of oil, one <i>green</i>
and the other <i>gold-brown</i>, are distinguished. Though
both are sold at the same price, there is a greater demand
for the green oil. According to the statements
of the distillers, the brown oil is derived from the leaves
of old plants and the green oil from the leaves of young
plants. It would seem, however, that the color is dependent
on the soil upon which the plants are grown, as
well as upon atmospheric influences. When ruku is
distilled with patchouli leaves, the oil is yellow and
thickly-fluid.</p>

<p>In Germany, the oil is now distilled from imported
leaves. It is thickly-fluid, of a brown color, and, in an
undiluted state, possesses a disagreeable, almost musty
odor. However, when sufficiently diluted and suitably
mixed with other volatile oils, the odor is far more
agreeable, and for this reason it has for some time
played an important part in the manufacture of perfumery.
It has the advantage of being very yielding
and lasting, but, on the other hand, possesses the disadvantage
of not combining with other perfumes, so that
its odor is always perceptible. It should always be
used in very small quantities or much diluted.</p>

<p>In commerce Penang oil and French oil are distinguished,
the first having a specific gravity of 0.959 and
the latter of 1.012. When kept for any length of time
the oil deposits patchouli-camphor (C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O) in prismatic
crystals of 1.045 specific gravity and melting at
127 to 129° F. These crystals have a peculiar, very
lasting odor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Patchouli oil is soluble in equal parts of 90 per cent.
alcohol, the contrary indicating that it is not pure. It
is chiefly adulterated with cedar oil.</p>

<p><i>Peppermint oil.</i>&mdash;The <i>Mentha</i> family furnishes commerce
with three oils differing essentially from each
other&mdash;<i>oil of curled mint</i>, <i>peppermint oil</i>, <i>and poley oil</i>.</p>

<p><i>Oil of curled mint</i> (<i>oleum menthæ crispæ</i>) is separated
by distillation with water from the leaves of <i>Mentha
crispa, Linn.</i> It is limpid, yellowish, sometimes greenish;
in time it becomes darker and more thickly-fluid.
Its specific gravity varies between 0.890 and 0.965. It
has a strong odor of curled mint and a pungent, somewhat
cooling, slightly bitterish taste. It is soluble in
all proportions in 90 per cent. alcohol. In commerce a
distinction is made between German and American oil
of curled mint, the latter generally containing oil of
turpentine and oil of sassafras. Odor, taste, and the
alcohol test suffice for the determination of the quality
of the oil.</p>

<p>Oil of curled mint contains a terpene, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>, and a
body isomeric with carvol, the carvol of curled mint,
C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O. Its specific gravity, boiling point and chemical
properties are the same as those of the carvol of caraway
oil, but it differs from it by its odor and turning the
plane of polarization to the opposite direction. In conjunction
with other volatile oils, oil of curley mint is
sometimes used for perfuming soaps.</p>

<p><i>Peppermint oil</i> (<i>oleum menthæ piperitæ</i>) is obtained
from the fresh flowering peppermint, <i>Mentha piperita</i>,
natural order <i>Labiatæ</i>. In commerce, German, English,
American and Japanese peppermint oils are distinguished.
As regards fineness, the German oil is inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to the English and better kinds of American oils, but
superior to the Japanese. The best and most expensive
oil is the English so-called "Mitcham oil of peppermint,"
which dissolves in 50 parts of 50 per cent. spirit of wine
and possesses a fine, pure taste, it being for this reason
preferred by distillers for the fabrication of liqueurs.
For perfuming purposes, however, the American as well
as the German oils are very suitable. Of American oils
that of H. G. Hotchkiss, L. B. Hotchkiss, Hale &amp; Parshall,
and Fritzsche Bros. enjoy a high reputation. The
Japanese oil is distinguished from the rest by a peculiar
train-oil-like odor and taste, and is in but little demand.</p>

<p>Crude oil of peppermint is yellowish to greenish and
contains much mucus; it has therefore to be subjected
to another distillation with water. The rectified oil is
clear as water, limpid, of a strong but pleasant odor and
a specific gravity of 0.900 to 0.902. Old oil thickens
and then shows an acid reaction. The greater portion
of the oil congeals at the freezing point of water; many
kinds, however, requiring but slight cooling in order to
become solid. The solid portion of the oil, <i>Menthol</i>,
(C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O) is a colorless, finely crystallized body with
an intense odor of peppermint. It melts at 107.6° F.,
is quite fluid at an ordinary temperature and boils at
413.6° F. Menthol is found in all oils of peppermint
most abundantly in the Japanese oil, which contains
from 50 to 55 per cent. of it. Mitcham oil is also very
rich in menthol, it containing from 40 to 45 per cent.,
while the American oil contains only from 20 to 25 per
cent.</p>

<p>American, German and English oils of peppermint
may be distinguished as follows: By adding to 5 or 6<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
drops of the oil, 25 to 30 drops of pure white concentrated
sulphuric acid, <i>American oil of peppermint</i> becomes
heated and emits vapors, the mixture acquiring a dark
brownish red coloration. After mixing with 8 to 10
cubic centimeters of 90 per cent. alcohol, the fluid
becomes turbid, pale yellowish brown, or reddish brown,
and on boiling clear pale brown. When mixed with
sulphuric acid, <i>German oil of peppermint</i> becomes heated
without emitting vapors, becomes yellowish red, not
very dark, and turbid. After diluting with alcohol, the
fluid becomes turbid and yellowish red, and on boiling
somewhat more transparent and currant-red. <i>English
oil of peppermint</i> treated in the same manner as the
others with sulphuric acid becomes very slightly heated
without any emission of vapor. After diluting with
alcohol, it becomes clear and raspberry red.</p>

<p>As adulterants of peppermint oil are mentioned:
fat oils, alcohol, oil of turpentine, copaiba oil, mustard
oil, and ginger oil. The most frequent adulteration is
an admixture of oil of turpentine. It is recognized by
the oil not dissolving clear in equal parts of 90 per
cent. alcohol, as is the case with the pure product. To
detect the presence of copaiba oil, mix 5 drops of the
oil to be tested with 15 to 20 drops of fuming nitric
acid, shake and allow it to stand for 1 to 2 hours.
After this time the oily portion should be neither entirely
nor partially congealed, but remain fluid. To detect
traces of mustard oil, bring 10 drops of the oil into a
wide reagent glass, then add 3 to 4 cubic centimeters
of absolute alcohol, 2 to 3 drops of silver nitrate solution
and 12 to 15 drops of ammonia. The mixture is
clear and colorless, and remains so on heating to boiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
In the presence of mustard oil turbidity and blackening
take place in consequence of the formation of silver
sulphide. After boiling, allow the fluid to stand quietly
for 2 or 3 hours. If it then shows a grayish turbidity,
the oil is adulterated with another volatile oil.</p>

<p>Instead of pure American oil of peppermint, a product
compounded with camphor oil, and mostly freed
from menthol, is said frequently to occur in commerce.
According to E. C. Federer, this is recognized by dissolving
one volume of oil of peppermint in 2 volumes
of 94 per cent. alcohol, adding water and shaking. Pure
peppermint oil is then separated with a certain portion of
the alcohol. For example, mix 10 cubic centimeters of oil
of peppermint in a graduated cylinder of 45 to 50 cubic
centimeters' capacity with 20 cubic centimeters of 94 per
cent. alcohol, then add 10 cubic centimeters of water of
50° F. and shake. After allowing the mixture to stand
quietly, two layers are formed, the upper one of which, if
the oil is pure, will amount to 14 cubic centimeters, but
only to 12.5 cubic centimeters if the oil is freed from
menthol and compounded with camphor oil. A larger
or smaller addition of water to the alcoholic mixture is
without influence upon the height of the upper layer
separated.</p>

<p>In perfumery peppermint oil serves chiefly for aromatizing
dentifrices, etc. It should be kept in well-closed
bottles in a shady place; an addition of 0.5 per cent. of
alcohol helps to preserve the oil for a long time.</p>

<p><i>Poley oil</i> (<i>oleum menthæ pulegii</i>).&mdash;In Southern France
and Spain this oil is obtained by distillation from the
leaves of <i>Mentha pulegium</i>. It has an odor resembling
that of peppermint, is at first colorless, but soon becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
yellow, has a specific gravity of 0.927, boils at 361.4°
to 370.4° F., and contains neither menthol nor carvol.
It is used for perfuming herb soaps.</p>

<p><i>Pimento oil</i>, or <i>oil of allspice</i> (<i>oleum pimenta</i>) from the
bruised fruit of <i>Eugenia pimenta</i>, allspice, natural order
<i>Myrtaceæ</i>. The oil is pale yellow, becoming reddish-brown
by age; it has a very pungent taste and intense
odor, very much resembling that of cloves. It is heavier
than water, its specific gravity being from 1.021 to 1.037.
It mixes with glacial acetic acid in all proportions. When
treated with nitric acid, pure pimento oil assumes a red
color, with strong effervescence.</p>

<p><i>Rose oil</i> or <i>attar of roses</i> (<i>oleum rosæ</i>) comes almost
exclusively from Bulgaria, where it is obtained by distillation
with water from the flowers of <i>Rosa damascena</i>.
The small quantities of an excellent quality of rose oil
prepared in Southern France from <i>Rosa provincialis</i>
remain in the country of their production and do not
even cover the local demand. The small productions of
Persia and India need also not be taken into consideration.
In Tunis, where formerly much rose water was
prepared from <i>Rosa canina</i> and also rose oil of a very
fine quality, the distillation of roses has, according to
Christo Christoff, been entirely abandoned, geranium oil
only being now produced. In the summer of 1884,
Schimmel &amp; Co., of Leipzic, Germany, made the experiment
to obtain oil on a large scale from indigenous
roses. The result was very satisfactory, 2000 lbs. of
rose leaves yielding about 1 lb. of oil, the extraordinarily
agreeable odor of which was so superior to that
of the Turkish oil, that notwithstanding the high price&mdash;double
that of Turkish oil&mdash;it found ready purchasers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
At the ordinary temperature the Leipzic oil is solid, it
only melting at 89.6° F.</p>

<p>In Bulgaria, Kazanlik, in the Tundscha Valley, is
the centre of the entire industry and the principal
market. Rose oil is there called "<i>gul-jag</i>" (<i>gul</i>, the
rose, and <i>jag</i>, oil). The annual production of Kazanlik
and neighboring places, amounting 50 years ago to from
450 to 650 lbs., has within a few years risen to the enormous
figure of 5500 lbs.</p>

<p>In Kazanlik two varieties of roses, known as the
"white rose" and "red rose," are cultivated; the former
being <i>Rosa alba, L.</i>, and the latter <i>Rosa damascena,
Miller</i>. By distillation the white rose yields an oil of
little perfume, but rich in stearoptene. On account of
its slight odor, the white rose is seldom distilled by
itself, but occasionally white and red roses are mixed
in order to obtain an oil rich in stearoptene, so that a
fraudulent admixture of a larger quantity of geranium
oil may be effected without great danger of detection.
The large plantations consist only of bushes of red roses.
But on the edges of the field a strip, a few feet wide,
is planted with white roses, so that only flowers of little
commercial value may be plucked by passers-by.</p>

<p>The flowers are gathered before sunrise, and, if possible,
the same day subjected to distillation. The latter
is effected in a very crude apparatus, over a direct fire.
The flowers are distilled with double their weight of
water, one-half of which is drawn off. The product of
several operations thus obtained is combined and again
distilled, when, however, only one-sixth is drawn off.
This distillate is allowed to stand for one or two days in
a place warmer than 59° F., when the oil floating on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the top is skimmed off. It may be supposed that on an
average 6600 lbs. of roses are required to obtain 2.2
lbs. of oil, and that these 6600 lbs. of roses correspond
to an area of 1 hectare (2.471 acres) planted with rose
bushes.</p>

<p>Pure, carefully-distilled rose oil is at first colorless,
but soon turns yellowish.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Its specific gravity is between
0.830 and 0.890. It consists of a liquid oil and
a stearoptene, the content of the latter varying very
much. It is a pure hydrocarbon, odorless, of specific
gravity, 0.840 to 0.860, and distils at 572° F. Hence
it is lighter than the elæoptene on which alone the odor
of the rose oil is dependent. Rose oil generally congeals
between 50° and 60° F., though sometimes at a higher
or lower degree, according to its content of stearoptene.
While some oils require the cold of winter for congealing,
others are in the heat of summer either entirely solid, or
form a fluid filled with many crystals. The odor of
rose oil is peculiarly honey-like, and too intense to be
agreeable, its entire deliciousness being only developed
by strong dilution, be it by dissolving in water or
alcohol, or by distribution upon large quantities of rigid
bodies, fats, soaps, etc. In alcohol it dissolves with
greater difficulty than all other volatile oils, 1 part of it
requiring for solution 140 to 160 parts of alcohol of
0.815 specific gravity.</p>

<p>The larger or smaller content of stearoptene in rose
oil seems to be dependent on climatic conditions, it
having been remarked that the quantity is the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the lower the temperature of the region. The oil from
the coldest and highest regions of the Balkan is richer
in stearoptene than that from the lower and warmer
regions.</p>

<p>The genuineness of rose oil is generally judged by its
odor, its capacity of congealing, and the manner of its
crystallization. The odor is by all means the most reliable
criterion, but requires much experience, and especially
reliable pure standard samples for comparison.
The capacity of congealing at certain conditions of temperature,
is, to be sure, also a requirement of genuine
rose oil, but, as previously mentioned, this property
varies very much, and is subject to different influences, so
that a fixed standard at which pure rose oil must congeal
cannot be established. Attention must, however, be
called to the fact that the quality of a rose oil does by
no means rise with its greater capacity to congeal, since
only the liquid oxygenated portion possesses odor.</p>

<p>Schimmel &amp; Co. bring at present into commerce a
liquid rose oil freed from stearoptene which can be
highly recommended for finer alcoholic perfumes. It
remains fluid at 32° F., but in a cold mixture congeals
to a gelatinous mass, and hence is not absolutely free
from stearoptene. It has an extremely fine and powerful
odor, and when dissolved in alcohol does not give
the disagreeable crystalline separations of the ordinary
rose oil, which produce a disturbing effect, especially in
the preparation of extracts.</p>

<p>For the insulation and determination of the stearoptene
in rose oil, Schimmel &amp; Co. proceed as follows:
Heat 50 grammes of oil together with 500 grammes of
75 per cent. alcohol to from 158° to 176° F. In cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>ing,
the stearoptene separates nearly quantitatively.
Separate it from the fluid, treat it again in the same
manner with 200 grammes of 75 per cent. alcohol, and
repeat the operation until the stearoptene is entirely free
from odor. Two treatments of the crude stearoptene
are generally sufficient. In this manner Schimmel &amp;
Co. obtained from 1887 German rose oil 32&frac12; per cent.
stearoptene, from 1888 German rose oil 34 per cent.,
from 1887 Turkish rose oil 12 to 13 per cent., and from
1888 Turkish rose oil 14 per cent.</p>

<p>It is evident that such a valuable product as rose oil
is much subjected to adulteration, it being even said
that oils containing scarcely 10 per cent. of genuine rose
oil occur in the market. The chief adulterant used by
the Bulgarians is the so-called geranium oil, but actually
ginger-grass oil derived from India, which is brought
by way of Arabia to Constantinople, and prepared for the
purpose of adulterating rose oil by treatment with lemon
juice and bleaching in the sun. The sophistication is
generally effected by sprinkling the ginger-grass oil
thus prepared upon the rose leaves before distilling.
The general characters of this oil are so similar to those
of rose oil that detection, when the adulteration is kept
within certain limits, is very difficult, so that during the
distilling time large buyers and exporters of rose oil are
forced to pay, besides their other officers in Kazanlik,
confidential native agents who constantly move around
in the distilling regions and report where distillation has
been carried on honestly, and where the ginger-grass oil
bottle has been seen. However, the prepared ginger-grass
oil is frequently not even distilled with the rose
leaves, but simply mixed with the finished rose oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether a rose oil is free from geranium or ginger-grass
oil is tested in Bulgaria, according to Christo
Christoff, by the freezing method, which is, however,
unreliable. It is based upon the fact that an addition
of geranium oil reduces the congealing point of rose oil.
Pure Bulgarian rose oil congeals at from 63.5° to 68°
F.; by the addition of geranium oil, the same oil congeals
at 61.25°, 59°, 56.75°, or at a still lower temperature,
according to the quantity added. The buyer when
purchasing oil carries with him two basins, one containing
hot and the other cold water, which he mixes in
order to obtain a fixed temperature, the operation being
controlled by a Réaumur thermometer. In the water
thus prepared he completely submerges a 20 gramme
flask containing 15 grammes of the oil to be tested. In
three minutes, needle-like crystals of the separating
stearoptene must appear, and in ten minutes crystallization
must be complete. According to the congealing
point thus established, the product is paid for. Oil
congealing below 59° F. being evidently adulterated is
rejected and bargained for at a special price.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to fraudulently make
this congelation appear within the limits of temperature
permitted, paraffine which dissolves well in rose oil being
formerly frequently added. In such case the oil may
congeal at from 65.75° to 68° F., but the crystals are
opaque, dirty yellow, and dissolve to a turbid paste
which collects on the surface. The simplest method is
to distil white roses with the red. The resulting product
has not as fine an odor as that from red roses
alone, but is richer in stearoptene. Such oil, which, unadulterated,
congeals perhaps at 68° F., can by the addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>tion
of geranium oil be reduced to from 63.5° to 65.75°
F., thus keeping within the limits permitted.</p>

<p>Numerous attempts have been made to find a rapid
and sure way for the detection of geranium oil in rose
oil, but thus far in vain. Attention must also be drawn
to the fact that the adulterant is frequently itself adulterated
with oil of turpentine before being sold to the
distillers of rose oil.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned ginger-grass oil, the
actual geranium oils from <i>Pelargonium odoratissimum</i>
and <i>P. roseum</i>, as well as rosewood oil, sandal-wood
oil, spermaceti, paraffine, and fat oils have been mentioned
as adulterants of rose oil. The geranium oils
having a by-odor of lemon oil, by which their presence
could be readily detected are not suitable for the purpose.
Neither can rosewood or sandal-wood oils be used, or
at least such adulteration would be so clumsy as to be
immediately recognized. Attempts to adulterate rose
oil by the addition of a fat crystallizable body together
with another volatile oil fail on account of the characteristic
properties of rose oil stearoptene, which resembles no
other body at present known. While rose oil stearoptene
is lighter than elæoptene and entirely volatile, spermaceti
possesses essentially different qualities. It does
not form such long and specifically light crystals as
rose oil stearoptene; hence it readily separates on the
bottom and on shaking exhibits a peculiar iridescent
loamy formation. Furthermore it melts at 122° F.,
and not being volatile, leaves, on heating, a greasy stain
upon paper, while the stearoptene melts at 95° F. and,
on heating, volatilizes completely without leaving a
greasy stain behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>If a rose oil is to be tested, expose the bottle containing
the oil to a moderate heat until the contents are entirely
liquid; then gently shake the bottle in order to
bring about an intimate mixture of elæoptene and stearoptene.
Now pour some of the oil into a cylindrical
glass flask of 20 to 40 cubic centimeters' capacity and
allow it to congeal; then, while heating in the hand,
observe how the rigid portions act in liquefying. These
rigid, crystalline portions should be transparently clear
and, being lighter than the fluid portion, float, while
liquefying, in the upper layer of the fluid. Hence, if
now the fluid be again allowed to congeal, the crystals
should appear within the upper half of the oil. The
above-mentioned volatile oils partially lack the property
of separating a stearoptene in crystals at from
33.8° to 50° F., and though they may have a rose
odor, it is not the mild, fragrant odor of genuine rose
oil. To recognize the latter, Guibourt makes use of
pure concentrated sulphuric acid. Stir together in a
watch-crystal an equal number of drops of the oil and
of the acid; pure rose oil preserves its characteristic
odor, while the foreign oils exhibit a disagreeable odor
even when mixed with genuine rose oil.</p>

<p>Schimmel &amp; Co. give a method for an approximate
quantitative determination of spermaceti in rose oil:
Boil 3 to 5 grammes of stearoptene, separated in the
manner above given, with 20 to 25 grammes of 5 per
cent. alcoholic potash lye for 5 to 6 hours; then evaporate
the alcohol and compound the residue with hot
water. In cooling, the greater portion of the stearoptene
separates in a crystalline mass upon the surface.
Now pour off the alkaline fluid, wash the stearoptene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
with cold water, then melt it again in hot water, allow
it to cool, pour off the water, and repeat the same operations
until the wash-water is neutral. The combined
aqueous fluids are twice shaken with ether to remove any
stearoptene suspended in them. The alcoholic lye separated
from the ether is acidulated with dilute sulphuric
acid and again extracted with ether. After evaporation
no residue (fatty acids) should remain. To control
the experiment weigh the regained stearoptene dried at
194° F., adding, of course, the ether used for extracting
the alkaline fluid. There will be a small loss, since
small quantities of stearoptene always evaporate in
drying.</p>

<p><i>Rosemary oil</i> (<i>oleum rosemarini</i> or <i>ol. anthos</i>) is obtained
in Southern Europe, especially in Southern France, Dalmatia
and Northern Italy, by distillation from the flowering
rosemary, <i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>, natural order
<i>Labiatæ</i>. It is, when fresh, limpid, colorless, or yellowish,
of a penetrating, camphor-like odor and taste, and
specific gravity 0.880 to 0.915. By age it becomes
darker and thickly-fluid. The French rosemary oil is
the best and most expensive. It is distinguished from
the Italian oil by its much more pleasant odor. Pure
French rosemary oil dissolves in an equal part of 90
per cent. alcohol, while the Italian product requires
2 to 3 parts. The cheaper rosemary oils are generally
adulterated with oil of turpentine, which is recognized
by the oil not dissolving in the above-mentioned proportion
in alcohol, as well as by the iodine test. Rosemary
oil does not detonate with iodine, but simply dissolves
with heating and perhaps the emission of vapors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The French rosemary oil forms one of the ingredients
of <i>eau de Cologne</i> and is used in other perfumery.</p>

<p><i>Rosewood oil or rhodium oil</i> (<i>oleum ligni rhodii</i>), is obtained
by distillation from the wood of the root and
lower trunk of <i>Convolvulus scopiarius</i> and <i>C. floridas, L.</i>,
two plants indigenous to the Canaries. The waste falling
off in the manufacture of rosewood beads is chiefly
used for the purpose. The oil is of a pale yellow color
becoming brown by age. It has a pleasant odor resembling
in some slight degree the fragrance of the rose. It
is sometimes used in cheap perfumery as a substitute
for rose oil.</p>

<p><i>Sandal-wood oil</i> (<i>oleum ligni sandali</i>) is distilled from
the white West Indian or dark yellow East Indian sandal-wood
(<i>Santalum myrtifolium</i>). For the purpose of
distillation the wood is rasped as finely as possible. The
oil obtained from the East Indian wood is the better
and more valuable. It has a dark yellow to brown color
and a pleasant intense, rose-like odor, while the West
Indian oil is pale yellow and of a less agreeable odor.
Both oils are very thickly-fluid. The quality and value
of sandal-wood oil are best judged by the odor, an
adulteration with cedar oil being readily detected thereby.</p>

<p><i>Sassafras oil</i> (<i>oleum ligni sassafras</i>), from the bruised
root of the sassafras tree, <i>Sassafras officinale</i>, natural
order <i>Lauraceæ</i>. Sassafras is one of the most widely
distributed trees of North America, being found in
Canada, in all of the United States, east of the prairies,
beyond the Mississippi, and in Mexico. The largest
amount of oil distilled is within sixty miles of Baltimore,
Md., which is the principal depot for its commerce.</p>

<p>Oil of sassafras varies in color from colorless to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
yellow and red. Its taste is pungent and aromatic,
being agreeable to most persons. It has a pleasant
odor resembling that of fennel, and is heavier than
water, its specific gravity being 1.08 to 1.09. It is
soluble in 4 to 5 parts of alcohol of 0.85 specific gravity,
and consists of a mixture of various oils, among which
is safrene (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>), a dextrorotatory terpene which boils
between 311° and 314.6° F. By strongly cooling in a
cold mixture, safrol, a crystallizing stearoptene of the
composition C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is separated. Safrol is the chief
constituent of sassafras oil. It is obtained in abundance
by cooling, at a temperature of 13° F., the portion
boiling between 442.4° and 455° F. It melts at 46.4°
F., and at a medium temperature forms a colorless clear
oil of pungent taste, characteristic odor, and specific
gravity 1.104. When the crystals have been heated to
above 158° F., they congeal only after remaining for
weeks at a temperature below 32° F., but on being
melted at 68° F., the fluid mass again congeals readily
on cooling. The safrol is neutral, optically inactive,
boils at 449.6° F., and is soluble in alcohol and ether.
Sassafras oil is said to be frequently adulterated with
oil of turpentine, which is, however, readily detected by
the energetic reaction and by distilling a sample of the
suspected oil.</p>

<p>Safrol is very suitable for perfuming ordinary soaps.
It has in a still higher degree than camphor oil the
property of removing the disagreeable odor of some fats,
while at the same time it imparts to the soaps an
aromatic, refreshing odor. As a rule 8 to 11 ozs. are
used for 220 lbs. of soap; but if it shall at the same
time serve for removing the disagreeable odor of low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
quality fats, especially those extracted with bisulphide
of carbon or benzine, it is advisable to take 2.2 lbs., or
still better, 4.4 lbs. for 220 lbs. of soap. In this case the
safrol should be added to the fat after melting and before
saponification and thoroughly mixed with it by stirring.
An excellent perfume for ordinary soaps is a mixture of
safrol and citronella oil, it being at any rate preferable
to oil of mirbane.</p>

<p>The standard of value for safrol is its specific gravity,
which should not be below 1.104 at 59° F. Specifically
lighter kinds contain camphor oil and other impurities.</p>

<p><i>Thyme oil</i> is obtained in Southern France and Spain
by distillation from the flowering thyme, <i>Thymus vulgaris,
L.</i> It is greenish-yellow to red (red thyme oil,
<i>oleum thymi rubrum</i>), but by rectification becomes colorless
(white thyme oil, <i>oleum thymi album</i>). Both oils
are quite limpid and possess a strong thyme odor. The
specific gravity of the red oil is 0.91 to 0.94, and that
of the rectified oil 0.87 to 0.89. The oil prepared from
the fresh plant shows, as a rule, a higher specific gravity
than that from the dried plant. Thyme oil consists
essentially of thymene (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>) besides some cymene
(C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>) and thymol (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O), the latter forming an
essential constitutent of the oil. Oils from which the
thymol has been withdrawn occur in commerce. Pure
thyme oil dissolves clear in every proportion in 90 per
cent. alcohol; if such is not the case, adulteration with
oil of turpentine is probable.</p>

<p>The oil distilled from the field thyme, <i>Thymus serpyllum,
L.</i>, is limpid, yellowish to gold yellow, and of specific
gravity 0.89 to 0.91. Old oil is red or brown and
no longer limpid. Good oil is soluble in every propor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tion
in 90 per cent. alcohol and emits only slight vapors
when brought in contact with iodine. It consists largely
of thymene and cymene, and contains a few per cent. of
phenol-like bodies.</p>

<p><i>Turpentine, oil of.</i>&mdash;Under the general name "oil of
turpentine" are comprised the volatile oils obtained by
distillation from the resins or other portions of different
species of the pine. There is a large number of these
oils, the most important ones of which shall here be mentioned,
though but a few are of interest to the perfumer.</p>

<p><i>Austrian oil of turpentine</i>, from <i>Pinus laricio, Poir</i>.&mdash;It
is colorless or yellowish, transparent; specific gravity,
0.864; boiling point, 311° to 314° F.; turns polarized
light to the left; soluble in 6 parts 90 per cent. alcohol.
When rectified it has a specific gravity of 0.862, and is
soluble in 7 parts of 90 per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p><i>German oil of turpentine</i>, from <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, <i>P.
abies</i>, <i>P. vulgaris</i>, <i>P. picea</i>, and <i>P. rotundata</i>, resembles
the former; specific gravity, 0.860 to 0.870; boiling
point, 311° to 320° F.; turns polarized light to the
left. When rectified it is soluble in 7 parts of 90 per
cent. alcohol.</p>

<p><i>French oil of turpentine</i>, from French turpentine of
<i>Pinus maritima</i>.&mdash;It is colorless or faint yellowish;
specific gravity, 0.860; boiling point, 313° to 315°
F.; turns polarized light to the left; odor peculiar;
taste burning. With 7 parts of 90 per cent. alcohol it
gives a clear solution.</p>

<p><i>Venetian oil of turpentine</i>, from Venice turpentine of
<i>Larix decidua, Mill.</i>, is laevorotatory and resembles
the preceding, but has a more agreeable odor. Venice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
turpentine is mostly obtained in Southern Tyrol and in
Piedmont, and yields 18 to 25 per cent. of oil.</p>

<p><i>American oil of turpentine</i>, from American turpentine
of <i>Pinus australis, Mich.</i>, and <i>P. Taeda, L.</i>&mdash;It resembles
French turpentine, but turns polarized light to the right.
Specific gravity, 0.864; boiling point, 302° to 312.8° F.</p>

<p><i>Pine oil</i> (<i>oleum abietis</i>) is obtained by distilling with
water the leaves or green cones of <i>Pinus picea, L.</i>, <i>Abies
pectinata, D. C.</i> Its odor is much finer than that of ordinary
oil of turpentine. It is soluble in 7 parts of 90
per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Dwarf pine oil, Krummholz or Latschenoel</i> (<i>oleum pini
pumilionis</i>), is obtained by distilling the young tops and
cones of <i>Pinus pumilio</i> with water. It has an agreeable
odor, reminding one of juniper; specific gravity, 0.865;
boiling point, 338° F. The oil is laevorotatory and
soluble in 12 to 15 parts of 90 per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Pine-leaf oil</i> is obtained by distilling the leaves of
<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> or <i>P. abies</i> by means of steam. It is
dextrorotatory; has a fine aromatic odor; boiling point,
320° F.; specific gravity, 0.875 to 0.876.</p>

<p><i>Templin oil</i> (<i>Kienoel</i>) (<i>oleum pini</i>, <i>ol. templinum</i>) is obtained
chiefly in some sections of Switzerland and Tyrol
by distilling the wood, branches, leaves, cones, etc., with
water. It has a lemon-like odor; specific gravity, 0.860
to 0.880; boiling point, 320° to 327° F., and is laevorotatory.</p>

<p><i>Balsam-pine oil</i> (<i>oleum abietis canadensis</i>) is obtained
in Canada from the branches of <i>Abies balsamea, D. C.</i>
It has a slightly yellowish color, a very agreeable and
refreshing odor; specific gravity, 0.902; boiling point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
at 320° to 330.8° F., and turns polarized light to the
right.</p>

<p>Of the different varieties of oil of turpentine mentioned
only pine oil and dwarf pine oil are used in
perfumery.</p>

<p>Oils of turpentine must be kept carefully protected
from light and air. When badly kept they gradually
become resinous with formation of formic and acetic
acids. When exposed to the air oil of turpentine absorbs
ozone; with iodine it detonates violently. When brought
in contact with a mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid
and nitric acid it ignites.</p>

<p><i>Verbena, oil of</i>, from the lemon verbena, <i>Aloysia citriodora,
Hooker</i>. The plant is cultivated in the gardens
of Grasse. The oil is extracted from the leaves by distillation
in August, but on account of its high price is
almost out of market, it being everywhere substituted
by the oil of lemon grass, <i>Andropogon citratus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Violet, oil of.</i>&mdash;The perfume of the violet, <i>Viola odorata</i>,
natural order <i>Violaceæ</i>, is due to a volatile oil of
a green color and of such a penetrating odor as to cause
headache; it acquires the agreeable odor of the violet
only by strong dilution. The violet farms from whence
the flowers are procured for the production of the oil,
are very extensive at Nice and in the neighborhood of
Florence. The oil is only obtained by the absorption
process, all other methods to procure it having failed up
to this time. It is scarcely obtainable in commerce, as
the French manufacturers, who prepare the greater part
of it, use the very small yield for manufacturing fine
perfumery.</p>

<p><i>Vitivert or vetiver oil</i> (<i>oleum iva ranchusa</i>) from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
so-called cuscus, the rhizome of an Indian grass, <i>Anathereum
muricatum</i>. The oil is obtained by distillation,
either from the fresh root in India, or from the imported
dried root in Europe. The yield is very small. The oil
is thickly-fluid, of a red-brown color, and has an intense,
but agreeable odor very much like that of oil of orris
root. Like the latter, it possesses the valuable property
of diffusing a lasting perfume. Its value can only be
judged by the odor, and hence it should only be purchased
from a thoroughly reliable firm.</p>

<p><i>Wintergreen oil</i> (<i>oleum gaultheriæ</i>) is obtained by distillation
from the wintergreen, <i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>,
a plant common in North America. It is thickly fluid,
yellowish green to gold yellow, of a sweetish, aromatic,
pungent taste and penetrating, narcotic odor, which
becomes agreeable only by strongly diluting the oil.
By rectification the oil becomes entirely colorless. Its
specific gravity is 1.170 to 1.190 (according to Gladstone,
1.142). It is sparingly soluble in water, but
readily so in alcohol, ether, chloroform, etc. The aqueous
or dilute alcoholic solution is colored deep violet by
ferric chloride.</p>

<p>Wintergreen oil boils at 392° F.; the boiling point,
however, soon rises to 431.6° F., when it remains constant.
Between 392° and 428° F. a terpene (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>)
constituting about 1/10 of the oil distils off; the rest corresponds
to the composition C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; it is methyl salicylate</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>


<p>Wintergreen oil is also obtained by distillation from
<i>Gaultheria punctata</i> and <i>Gaultheria leucocarpa</i>. An
oil, very closely resembling wintergreen oil, is in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
country distilled from the young shoots of the American
species of birch, <i>Betula lenta</i>, variously called sweet
birch, black birch, cherry birch, and mountain mahogany.
According to Procter, the oil does not exist in the birch
but is formed by the action of the water upon an odorless
body, called gaultherin, which is converted into
volatile oil by the reaction of another substance analogous
to emulsin. Hence the formation of oil is similar
to that of oil of bitter almonds. To obtain the oil from
<i>Betula lenta</i>, the material is chopped up and placed in
the still, as much as this will hold, a sufficient quantity of
water being then added to fill the still about one-third full.
The still is generally permitted to remain in this condition
over night, a fire is made in the morning and distillation
proceeds nicely. The manufacture of birch
oil is carried on at quite a large scale by Mr. A. H.
Seidle, of Middleport, Schuylkill County, Pa.</p>

<p>Methyl salicylate may also be artificially prepared by
heating a mixture of methyl alcohol, sulphuric acid and
salicylic acid whereby at first methyl-sulphuric acid is
formed which is then converted into methyl ether and
sulphuric acid:&mdash;</p>

<p>Etherification succeeds without difficulty, it being sufficient
to heat the mixture for some time and then pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
it into water whereby the ether separates as a heavy
layer of oil. After washing with water distil in a direct
current of steam. The ether thus obtained is as clear
as water and, as regards its other properties, does not
differ from the naturally occurring oil. This artificial
wintergreen oil is now much used for perfuming
purposes.</p>

<p>Wintergreen oil is said to be frequently adulterated
with sassafras oil which is also specifically heavier than
water. If, according to Hayer, 5 drops of the oil in a
test-tube be mixed with 10 drops of crude concentrated
nitric acid, a deep blood-red fluid results in one minute
if oil of sassafras is present. In the course of another
minute, the fluid separates a brown resinous mass. Pure
oil, on the other hand, is but little altered.</p>

<p>According to P. MacEwan the adulteration of wintergreen
oil with camphor oil is carried on at a large scale.
The presence of camphor oil may be recognized by the
specific gravity, 0.900, while that of pure wintergreen
oil is, on an average, 1.18. A crude test&mdash;which is,
however, readily executed&mdash;is as follows: Stir a few
drops of the suspected oil in water. If pure, the oil
in a few seconds sinks to the bottom, but if it contains
camphor oil several minutes elapse before it deposits,
and there is time to observe that the particles of oil
assume different forms, but not a globular one.</p>

<p><i>Ylang-Ylang oil</i> (<i>oleum unonæ</i>) is obtained by distilling
the flowers of <i>Unona odoratissima</i>, indigenous to
the Philippine Islands, the Straits of Malacca, and Indian
Archipelago. The oil is colorless to yellowish.
Its color and specific gravity, however vary very much,
according to the season of the year in which it is pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>pared,
the oil distilled in the cold season being more
colorless and limpid than that produced in the warm
season. The oil has an exquisite odor, partaking of the
jasmine and the lilac, and is used in the manufacture of
the finest perfumery. Various kinds are found in commerce,
that marked "Sartorius" being preferred.</p>

<p>The difference in quality of the many kinds of oil
found in commerce is chiefly due to the method of preparation
and the selection of the flowers, which possess
the finest aroma when freshly gathered. In distilling,
the first light volatile portions passing over have an
incomparable perfume, while the oil distilling over later
on possesses an insipid odor. Hence the manufacturer,
who only obtains the first portions, will furnish the
finest quality of oil, and it is this method of preparation
which has gained the "Sartorius" oil its high reputation.
While according to Schimmel &amp; Co.'s report, 220 lbs. of
fresh ylang-ylang flowers yield 2.64 lbs. of oil, Sartorius
for the preparation of his fine oil distils off only about
half the quantity.</p>

<p><i>Conanga oil</i> is a poorer quality of ylang-ylang oil,
obtained from the same plant. Two varieties are distinguished
in commerce, viz: the <i>Javanese</i> and <i>Indian</i>.
The Java oil is the best, and may be used where
ordinary qualities of ylang-ylang oil will do. According
to Schimmel &amp; Co.'s report the cheaper Indian oil is
very resistant and durable in soaps, especially when
combined with licari or linaloë oil.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2></div>

<p class="subh">RESINS AND BALSAMS.</p>


<p>The term <i>resins</i> is applied to certain organic substances
which are very closely related to volatile oils, in
so far as many of them are formed from the latter by
oxidation. As previously mentioned, by exposure to
the atmospheric air all volatile oils undergo a change,
whereby they thicken and are finally converted into
substances possessing the character of resins. In nature
most resins also occur mixed with volatile oils.</p>

<p>The elementary constituents of resins are carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen; but, generally speaking, they
are poor in oxygen and rich in carbon. Chemically
they behave like weak acids, their solutions frequently
reddening litmus and sometimes expelling, on boiling,
the carbonic acid from alkaline carbonates.</p>

<p>Independent of a possible content of volatile oil,
every naturally occurring resin consists of several resins
which, however, can, as a rule, be separated only with
difficulty.</p>

<p>The resins are generally divided into <i>hard resins</i>, <i>soft
resins</i> or <i>balsams</i>, and <i>gum-resins</i>. The hard resins are,
at the ordinary temperature, solid, hard, and brittle, can
be readily pulverized, and contain little or no volatile
oil. The soft resins or balsams are kneadable, and
sometimes even semi-fluid; they represent solutions of
resins in volatile oils, or a mixture of volatile oil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
resin. On exposure to the air they are changed by the
volatile oil suffering oxidation, they becoming then more
or less hard, and may be converted into actual resins.
The gum-resins are mixtures of vegetable gum, resin,
and volatile oils, and are obtained by inspissation of the
milky juice of several plants. When triturated with
water they yield a milky, turbid fluid, and dissolve
only partially in alcohol.</p>

<p>The resins are widely diffused in the vegetable kingdom,
there being scarcely a plant which does not contain
resin in one form or another. Some families of plants
and organs of plants are, however, distinguished by
their special wealth of resins. The resins are, as a rule,
secreted simultaneously with volatile oils in special
reservoirs, from which they flow out naturally at certain
periods, or are obtained by incisions made in the plants.
A few bodies of the character of resins also occur in the
animal kingdom, and a series of them, the fossil resins,
are generally classed in the mineral kingdom, though
most of them are very likely derived from plants. Some
resins, such as the aldehyde resins, etc., are purely artificial
products.</p>

<p>Of the hard resins, benzoin alone is used in perfumery;
of the balsams, Peru balsam, Tolu balsam, and
storax balsam; and of the gum-resins, the myrrh.</p>

<p><i>Benzoin</i> is exclusively obtained from <i>Styrax benzoïn,
Dryand</i> (<i>Benzoïne officinale, Hayne</i>), a tree which
grows in Java, Sumatra, and Siam. The bark of the
tree is slit to allow a fluid to flow out, which concretes
on the trunk in the form of grains, or is collected in
vessels in which it congeals and assumes the form of
lumps ("tampangs"). Older trees which have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
frequently tapped for resin yield a product of a lower
quality; the grains ("tears") forming, as a rule, the
better varieties. When the benzoin collects in large
masses it always shows an amygdaloid structure, the
grains ("almonds") of a roundish form, smooth termination,
homogeneous structure, and paler color, appearing
imbedded in a dark, porous, or resiniform mass.</p>

<p>According to the appearance of the product three
varieties are distinguished: Benzoin in tears (<i>B. in
lacrimis</i>), <i>amygdaloid benzoin</i> (<i>B. amygdaloides</i>), and lump
benzoin (<i>B. in sortis</i>, <i>B. in massis</i>). The <i>benzoin in
tears</i> forms loose, smoothly terminated, longish, homogeneously
appearing masses of an opal-like lustre, and
first of a whitish, and later on, of a yellowish, reddish,
or brownish color. The separate pieces are up to 3
millimeters in diameter, though the Siam benzoin in
tears frequently consists of still larger and generally
decidedly flattened pieces.</p>

<p><i>Amygdaloid benzoin</i> consists chiefly of white pieces,
becoming, later on, brownish, of a waxy lustre and imbedded
in a lustrous brown-red resinous mass. The
<i>lump benzoin</i> or <i>ordinary benzoin</i> has also an amygdaloid
structure but is not so rich in almonds as the preceding
variety and possesses either a fine granular or colophony-like
ground-mass and is frequently contaminated by parts
of plants. The exterior of the variety occurring in
commerce in large lumps shows, according to the mode
of packing, the imprint of leaves or of coarse pack-cloth.</p>

<p>Benzoin generally consists of cinnamic and benzoic
acids which occur in a crystalline state in the grains as
well as the ground-mass; further, of several amorphous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
resins soluble in alcohol, and coloring matter. The content
of cinnamic and benzoic acids amounts to from 12
to 20 per cent. The best varieties from Sumatra and
Singapore contain no benzoic acid, and those from Siam
no cinnamic acid.</p>

<p>All varieties of benzoin possess a peculiar odor, that
of the better varieties being agreeable, and a sweet,
aromatic, but pungent taste. The melting point generally
lies between 176° and 203° F., that of the tears
and of the almonds being lower than that of the ground-mass.
A low melting-point is accepted as a mark of
quality, Siam benzoin, which is considered the best,
melting at 167° F. Some varieties, for instance, those
recently imported from Singapore, have a pronounced
vanilla-like odor; the presence of vanillin has been
established in them. The Sumatra benzoin has a
storax-like odor.</p>

<p>Benzoin is sparingly soluble in chloroform, only partially
so in ether, and completely in alcohol. On mixing
the alcoholic solution with water, the resin is
separated. Petroleum-ether and benzine withdraw only
benzoic acid from the dry, powdered benzoin. All
varieties of benzoin dissolve in concentrated sulphuric
acid to a beautiful purple colored fluid, from which
benzoic acid, if present, is separated in crystals by the
gradual addition of water. The establishment of the
presence of cinnamic acid is best effected as follows:
Boil the sample in milk of lime, filter, and treat the
solution with hydrochloric acid. The precipitate thereby
separated is thoroughly washed, triturated with potassium
permanganate and water, and heated, whereby in
the presence of cinnamic acid, oil of bitter almonds is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
formed from the latter, which is readily recognized by
the odor.</p>

<p>If benzoin containing benzoic acid be heated, white
vapors are emitted which, on cold surfaces, deposit in
very delicate, lustrous, acicular, or foliated crystals of
benzoic acid, the so-called benzoin flowers (<i>Floris benzoes</i>.)
Benzoic acid thus prepared possesses an agreeable,
vanilla-like odor, since by heating the benzoin the
greater portion of the odoriferous substance contained
in it escapes. Benzoic acid separated by the wet method
is odorless.</p>

<p>Benzoin is especially used for fumigating pastilles.
It is also of great importance on account of its property
of preventing fats from becoming rancid, if added to
them in small quantities.</p>

<p><i>Peru balsam</i> (<i>Balsamum Peruvianum</i>) is the produce
of the Balsam Coast, San Salvador, Central America,
where Sansonate forms the central point of the industry.
In the mountain forests, back of the coast, grows the
balsam tree (<i>Myroxylon Pereiræ, Klotzch</i>; <i>Toluiferæ
Pereiræ, Baillon</i>), natural order, <i>Papilionaceæ</i>. The
gaining of balsam commences when the tree is five years
old, the collecting time beginning in the dry season in
the first days of November. The trunks of the trees
are belabored with hammers on four places (according
to other statements, on twenty to thirty), so that the
bark is detached in strips. After a few days the bark
thus loosened is burnt off by means of torches, whereupon
a balsamic fluid oozes from the young wood, which
is absorbed by pieces of cloth or rags, placed upon the
denuded places. When the rags are thoroughly saturated
with balsam, they are squeezed out and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
thrown into an earthen pot filled with boiling water,
whereby the balsam is detached and collects on the bottom
of the vessel. By this process the <i>Balsamo de trapó</i>
is obtained. By boiling the bark, which falls off, a
small quantity of a poorer quality of balsam, called
<i>tacuasonte</i>, is obtained, which, it would seem, is frequently
added to the better quality. Crude Peruvian
balsam is a gray-green to dirty-yellow fluid, of the consistency
of syrup. The process of purification in use on
the Balsamic Coast is as follows: The crude balsam is
brought into large iron vessels, holding from 1300 to
1500 lbs. each, and allowed to clarify by quietly standing
from 8 to 14 days, the heavy impurities settling on
the bottom, while the light dirt, together with the water,
appears as foam on the surface. After 8 to 14 days
the balsam is drawn off through a cock, located about
4&frac34; inches above the bottom of the vessel, into a tinned
iron boiler, and boiled over an open fire at a moderate
heat for 2 to 3 hours. The foam which forms is skinned
off, and boiling continued until no more foam appears.</p>

<p>The collection of balsam continues until the first rain
falls in April or May, when the work ceases. A vigorous
tree, well treated, yields balsam for 30 years in
succession, and if then allowed to rest 5 or 6 years can
be used several years longer. The annual yield of balsam
from 100 trees is said to be about 550 lbs.</p>

<p>From the very odoriferous flowers of the balsam tree
or, according to others, by expressing the fruits, a <i>white</i>
Peruvian balsam is obtained, which is, however, seldom
found in commerce. It is of the consistency of honey,
pale-yellow, smells of vanilla and melilot, and has an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
aromatic bitter taste. On standing for some time it deposits
crystals of myroxocarpin.</p>

<p>Ordinary (black) Peruvian balsam is a black-brown
fluid, transparent and dark (honey-yellow in thin
layers), which retains its consistency even after being
kept for years and deposits no crystals. It shows a
slight acid reaction, has an agreeable odor reminding one
of gum benzoin and vanilla, and at first a mild, but, later
on, a sharp and pungent taste.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of pure Peru balsam formerly
varied between 1.14 and 1.16, but at present between
1.135 and 1.145, this change in the specific gravity
being very likely due to a different process of
purification.</p>

<p>Peru balsam is miscible in every proportion with
absolute alcohol, while ether leaves behind undissolved
a black, smeary residue, and hot oils of turpentine or
almonds dissolve only about one-half. It is miscible
with acetone, chloroform, amyl alcohol. By digesting
the balsam with aqueous potash lye, <i>Peru balsam oil</i>,
which constitutes about 60 per cent. of the balsam,
separates on the surface. In an undecomposed state the
oil is, according to Kachler, chiefly benzyl, cinnamate,
or cinnamein. The potash solution separated from the
Peru balsam oil, contains cinnamic acid, benzoic acid,
and resin. The latter, according to Stotze, can be separated
into two portions, one soluble, and the other
insoluble, in aqueous alcohol.</p>

<p>Benzine and petroleum-ether dissolve from the Peru
balsam only the nearly colorless cinnamein of which it
contains up to 45 per cent. The behavior of Peru balsam
towards bisulphide of carbon is very characteristic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
3 parts of it giving, according to Flückiger, a clear
solution with 1 part of bisulphide of carbon; if, however,
8 parts more of the latter be added, up to 30 per
cent. of a dark resin is separated, while the bisulphide
of carbon is but slightly colored.</p>

<p>From San Salvador 11,000 to 13,000 lbs. of Peru
balsam are annually brought to Europe, it being generally
imported in tin cans, and more rarely in earthen
jars surrounded by a kind of plaited matting. According
to whether the product comes by way of England,
New York, Bremen, or Hamburg, it is distinguished as
English, American, Bremen, or Hamburg Peru balsam.
The supply being frequently insufficient, the balsam is
subjected to many adulterations. A cheap, so-called
London Peru balsam always contained colophony and
had a specific gravity of 1.133. There can be no doubt
that pure unadulterated Peru balsam is difficult to
obtain.</p>

<p>As adulterants, are used: Alcohol, volatile oils, fat
oil, especially castor oil; further, copaiba balsam, Canada
balsam, gurjun balsam, storax, benzoin, and asphaltum.
The establishment of these adulterants is connected
with difficulties; but the properties of Peru balsam
are so characteristic that it is quite easy to detect
whether it is genuine and pure, or not, the specific
gravity and proportions of solubility deserving especial
attention in this respect. The test by the specific
gravity is available, since most of the adulterants render
the balsam specifically lighter, especially alcohol, but
also copaiba balsam (specific gravity, O.95), castor oil
(0.96), oil of turpentine (0.87), gurjun (0.96), etc. The
customary procedure is as follows: Prepare a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
salt solution of 1.25 specific gravity, by dissolving 1 part
of dried sodium chloride in 5 parts of distilled water;
drop the balsam into the solution; every drop of pure
Peru balsam sinks in a roundish form to the bottom;
but if the drop again comes to the surface and spreads
out upon it, it is a sure sign of some kind of adulteration.
However, the change in the specific gravity by
the admixture of fat oils is but very slight, since the
balsam can only be mixed with them to a conformable
fluid in the proportion of from 7 to 10 to 1. Castor oil
forms an exception in this respect, it being miscible also
in other proportions.</p>

<p>Petroleum-ether is an excellent testing agent. Bring
into a test-tube about 2.5 grammes of Peru balsam, and
6 to 7 centimeters of petroleum-ether, close the tube
with the finger and shake vigorously; a brown, thickly-fluid
mass adheres in unequal layers to the sides of
the tube, and before running together remains in this
position 1 to 2 minutes after the petroleum-ether has
been poured into a porcelain saucer. If, however, the
mass is thinly-fluid, and does not, in the above-mentioned
manner, adhere to the sides of the tube, but, after shaking,
collects below the petroleum-ether, the balsam is
adulterated. After shaking, immediately pour off the
petroleum-ether; if the latter is almost colorless, or
but slightly colored yellowish, the balsam is pure; if,
however, it is turbid, and soon forms a sediment, or if
it is yellow or brownish, or brown, the balsam is adulterated.</p>

<p>Alcohol is added either by itself or in the form of
saturated solution of storax, benzoin, or Canada balsam,
by which means the specific gravity of the balsam is but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
slightly changed. Bring the above-mentioned common
salt solution, together with 20 grammes of the Peru
balsam to be examined, into a small flask, and distil off
about 5 grammes; gradually mix the distillate with 5
drops of caustic potash lye and potassium iodide solution
saturated with iodine, shaking gently until the
mixture acquires a slightly yellow-brownish coloration.
If this coloration does not disappear in one minute,
add drop by drop more of the potash lye until discoloration
appears. In the presence of alcohol, yellow crystals
of iodoform, which are readily recognized under the
microscope by their form, collect on the bottom of the
fluid. Adulteration with a volatile oil is recognized in
the distillate by odor and taste.</p>

<p>Fat oil, Canada balsam, copaiba balsam, gurjun balsam,
and volatile oil may be recognized by the following
tests: If pure Peru balsam in a porcelain saucer
is thoroughly mixed with an equal volume of pure concentrated
sulphuric acid, the mixture thereby becomes
heated, vapors of a pungent odor being emitted, and if
then set aside to cool, it congeals. In the presence of
fat or volatile oils, copaiba balsam, gurjun balsam, or
Canada balsam, it remains, however, more or less thickly
fluid or more or less soft-smeary. If the balsam be
pure, the cold mixture, after washing with water, should
yield a hardish or soft-friable mass, which, when
kneaded with the fingers, should not prove smeary or
sticky.</p>

<p>Fat oils are also very readily recognized by the use
of warm petroleum-ether. The extract is evaporated,
saponified with potash lye, extracted with alcohol, evaporated
and decomposed with hydrochloric acid. A mix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>ture
of cinnamic acid and any of the fatty acids present
in the Peru balsam is thereby obtained, which, after
treatment with water, remains in the residue.</p>

<p>Of copaiba balsam, Peru balsam can take up as much
as 25 per cent. From such adulterated balsam benzine
dissolves the copaiba balsam, together with cinnamein,
and the adulteration can then be recognized by
the odor. Cinnamein treated with sulphuric acid acquires
a cherry-red color, while in the presence of copaiba
balsam or gurjun balsam, a yellow-brown coloration
appears. The detection of an adulteration of Peru balsam
with storax is, according to Denner, effected as
follows: Shake in a test-tube 5 parts of the balsam
to be examined with 5 parts of a 15 per cent. soda solution
(soda lye of 1.60 specific gravity) and 10 parts
of water. Then shake with 15 parts of ether, and
after settling pour off the ether as much as possible.
Repeat the shaking with 15 parts of fresh ether. Now
heat the aqueous residue to boiling, acidulate with
hydrochloric acid, add cold water, remove the resin separated
thereby from the fluids, dissolve it in about 3 parts
of soda lye of the above-mentioned strength, dilute with
20 parts of water, heat to boiling, and precipitate with
barium chloride solution. Bring the precipitate upon
the filter, and, after allowing it to drain off, dry it in the
water-bath. Then extract it with alcohol, evaporate
the alcoholic extract, take it up with concentrated sulphuric
acid, add chloroform, and shake. In the presence
of gum benzoin or storax, the chloroform acquires a
violet to blue color. This method is a sure test for the
recognition of even very small admixtures.</p>

<p>A content of asphaltum is readily detected by mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the Peru balsam with ether compounded with about ⅛
alcohol. Any asphaltum present remains undissolved,
and may be collected upon a filter.</p>

<p>In perfumery Peru balsam is chiefly used for pomades
and fumigating pastilles, but also for cosmetics and
soaps.</p>

<p><i>Tolu balsam</i> is the produce of <i>Myroxylon toluiferum,
Humb.</i>, <i>Bonpl.</i> et <i>Kunth</i>, <i>Toluifera balsamum, L.</i>, a
tree of the natural order <i>Papilionaceæ</i>, growing in
Northwestern South America. It exudes during the
heat of the day, and is collected in gourds. It soon
hardens, by which it is distinguished from Peru balsam.
In commerce two varieties of Tolu balsam are found,
one of the consistency of turpentine and the other solid.
The first variety, Brazilian balsam, forms a semi-fluid,
turpentine-like, sticky mass, of the color of copaiba
balsam. By long storage it becomes hard and brownish.
The solid variety, Tolu, or Carthagena balsam, is a
brittle, more or less translucent yellow-brown or red-brown
resin of a granular or crystalline appearance. It
softens at about 86° F., and melts between 140° and
149° F. Viewed under the microscope, it appears rich
in crystals of separated ciannamic and benzoic acids.
Its specific gravity varies between 1 and 2. Both varieties
of Tolu balsam have an aromatic, slightly pungent
and sourish taste, resembling somewhat that of Peru
balsam. They are readily soluble in ordinary spirit of
wine, alcohol, acetone, chloroform, and potash lye, but
insoluble in petroleum-ether and bisulphide of carbon.
In Tolu balsam have been found toluene, cinnamic and
benzoic acids, and several resins not yet sufficiently examined.
According to Scharling, toluene constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
about 1 per cent. of the Tolu balsam. It forms a colorless,
limp oil, boils, according to Deville, at 338° F.,
and according to E. Kopp, at between 309° and 320° F.,
and has a specific gravity of 0.858. It has a sharp,
pungent, pepper-like taste, and an odor resembling that
of elemi. In the air, it is gradually converted by
oxidation into a soft resin, without, however, becoming
colored.</p>

<p>On boiling Tolu balsam with water, cinnamic and
benzoic acids are separated from the solution. When
treated with potash lye the resinous acids are fixed, and
the toluene floats upon the fluid.</p>

<p>Commercial Tolu balsam is frequently more or less
mixed with vegetable remains, which, however, can be
readily detected with the microscope, especially after
the solution of the resinous constituents. It is frequently
adulterated with turpentine or pine resin.
Such adulterations may be detected by bisulphide of
carbon, which completely dissolves these substances,
but not the Tolu balsam. When pure Tolu balsam is
triturated with concentrated sulphuric acid, a cherry-red
fluid is, according to Ulex, obtained, which does not
evolve sulphurous acid, as is the case in the presence of
turpentine-resins.</p>

<p>Tolu balsam is chiefly used for fumigating pastilles.
The tincture prepared from it is also frequently used
with advantage to give durability to the scent of handkerchief
perfumes.</p>

<p>According to Holmes and Nalor, a Tolu balsam differing
in its chemical behavior is found in the English
wholesale trade. In thick layers it is yellow-brown,
but perfectly transparent and gold-yellow in thin layers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and extraordinarily sticky. By storage it hardens but
slightly, and does not become brittle even if exposed for
several days to a temperature of 212° F. Its odor reminds
one somewhat of glue, and it develops a pungent,
sharp taste only after chewing it for a few seconds. Its
melting point lies at 136.4° F., being lower than that
of ordinary Tolu balsam, from which it also differs in
that it completely dissolves in ether as well as in benzine,
while it is only partially dissolved by potash lye.
The balsam contains no toluene, nor a hydrocarbon,
boiling at 320° F. Further investigations have shown
it actually to be a natural product, the derivation of
which, however, could not be ascertained.</p>

<p><i>Storax</i> is the produce of <i>Liquid ambar orientale, Mill</i>, a
plantain-like tree which reaches a height of about 32 feet.
In Southern Asia Minor, especially in Cyprus, the tree
forms handsome, dense forests. According to Flückiger,
the balsam is extracted from the peeled-off bark, with
the assistance of warm water. The mass thus melted
out sinks down in the water, and is later on combined
with the substance obtained by expressing the boiled
bark while still warm. This mixture forms the <i>liquid
storax</i> (<i>Storax liquidus</i>). The residue remaining after
expression is dried in the sun and forms, under the
name of <i>Cortex thymiamatis</i>, an article of commerce,
which is used for fumigating purpose, for the preparation
of ordinary storax, etc. The crude storax is brought
to Smyrna, Syra, and Kos, and comes into the European
market almost exclusively from Trieste.</p>

<p>Liquid storax is a sticky, opaque substance of the consistency
of turpentine. It has a mouse-gray color, which
by contact with the air becomes brown on the surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
an agreeable benzoin-like odor, and a sharp, pungent,
aromatic taste. It is heavier than water, its specific
gravity being 1.112 to 1.115. On losing its content of
moisture (by drying out when heated) it becomes brown
and clear. When exposed to the air in a thick layer it
does not completely dry, and in a thin layer only after
considerable time; but when pressed with the finger
always shows a certain stickiness. It is partially soluble
in spirits of wine, yielding with it a more or less
turbid solution. It is also incompletely soluble in oil of
turpentine, benzine, petroleum-ether, and chloroform.
Viewed under the microscope liquid storax appears as a
colorless thickish fluid, intermingled with larger and
smaller drops, fragments of bark tissue, and now and
then, perhaps, with crystals of styracin and cinnamic
acid.</p>

<p>Liquid storax contains styrol (10 to 15 per cent.),
styracin, and cinnamic acid (10 to 15 per cent.). Styrol
or cinnamol seems to be the most important carrier of
the odor and taste of liquid storax. If 20 parts of liquid
storax are subjected to distillation together with 15 parts
of crystallized soda and 200 parts of water, the cinnamol
collects in the form of a yellowish, very mobile liquid
upon the distillate. By rectification it can be obtained
colorless, but is thereby partially converted into metastyrol,
an isomeric, amorphous, odorless, and tasteless
substance which is solid at an ordinary temperature.
By exposure for some time to a heat of 608° F. it is
reconverted into styrol. Styrol (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) forms a clear,
colorless, mobile liquid having an odor of benzine and
naphthalene. Its specific gravity is 0.924 and its boiling
point lies at 294.8° F. In water it is but sparingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
soluble, but is miscible in all proportions with anhydrous
spirit of wine, chloroform, benzine, ether, and oils. It
stands in the same relation to cinnamic acid as benzol
to benzoic acid, and is formed by distilling a mixture of
cinnamic acid and barium oxide.</p>

<p>Styracin is cinnyl cinnamate. On distilling liquid
storax with water, styrol passes over. If now from the
residue the cinnamic acid be withdrawn by means of
soda-solution, and the resin, which remains behind, be
treated with cold spirit of wine, styracin is left, which
crystallizes from ether, hot alcohol, or benzol. It forms
colorless, odorless, and tasteless crystals which melt at
113° F. and remain for a long time fluid after melting.
It is insoluble in water, but soluble in 25 parts cold,
and 2 parts boiling, spirit of wine, as well as in 5 parts
ether. By oxidizing substances it is converted into bitter
almond oil and benzoic acid, and by the action of potassium
hydroxide it is decomposed to cinnyl alcohol and
cinnamic acid.</p>

<p>Good liquid storax should yield to 90 per cent. alcohol
at least so much soluble matter that the dried residue
of the filtered alcoholic solution amounts to 65 per
cent. of the quantity of storax.</p>

<p>Ordinary liquid storax, which has not been stored too
long, contains 10 to 20 per cent. of water and about the
same quantity of impurities (fragments of plant tissue)
which remain behind on treatment with the above-mentioned
solvents.</p>

<p>Liquid storax is said to be adulterated with the turpentines
of some species of larch and pine. Such adulteration
is primarily detected, according to Hager, by
the specific gravity. Take up a drop of the balsam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
with a knitting-needle, and by heating the needle make
it fall into a cold solution of 1 part common salt and 8
parts water. On stirring, the drop must sink, otherwise
adulteration with turpentine is very likely. Next bring
5 grammes of the storax into a test-tube, melt it in the
water-bath, add &frac12; volume of absolute alcohol, and mix
by shaking; then compound the mixture with several
times its volume of petroleum-ether, shake vigorously,
allow to settle, and decant the layer of petroleum-ether.
Repeat twice this shaking with petroleum-ether; then
evaporate the petroleum-ether solution in a tared flask
in the water-bath. The residue remaining after evaporation
is colorless, bluish opalescent, and of an agreeable
odor; in the presence of turpentine it is yellowish and
has the, not to be mistaken, odor of turpentine.</p>

<p><i>Storax in grains</i> consists of round, longish grains of a
brown-black color and smooth, lustrous surface, which
soften by the warmth of the hand. It is nothing but
liquid storax brought into a granular form and by storing
freed more or less from impurities.</p>

<p><i>Ordinary storax</i> (<i>Styrax calamitus</i> or <i>St. vulgaris</i>) is an
artificial product prepared by mixing liquid storax with
various comminuted vegetable substances. Formerly
the above-mentioned bark of the storax tree (<i>Cortex
thymiamatis</i>) was only used for this purpose, but at
present sawdust and exhausted cinnamon are also
taken. This storax forms a reddish or brown-black,
humus-like mass, which is generally moist. When
dried it is very friable and has a storax-like odor
distinctly calling to mind that of cinnamon. Good
qualities are abundantly covered with crystalline efflorescences
(of cinnamic acid and styracin); poorer quali<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>ties
prepared with the addition of sawdust have a musty
odor. The admixed vegetable tissue can, according to
Wiesner, be readily recognized by boiling the storax
with alcohol, and after washing treating with dilute
chromic acid, to which a small quantity of sulphuric
acid has been added.</p>

<p>Liquid storax was already used for fumigating purposes
by the ancient Greeks and Jews, and it forms to-day
a constituent of fumigating pastilles, essences, etc.
Storax tincture furthermore possesses the property of
giving more constancy to scents resembling it. Piesse
says, in regard to the odor of liquid storax, that it combines
the agreeable with the disagreeable, it possessing
partially an odor similar to that of the tuberose and
partially one reminding of coal-tar oil. However, it
possesses this disagreeable odor only in a concentrated
state; when finely divided or diluted, it diffuses a very
agreeable perfume.</p>

<p>Under the name <i>American storax</i>, <i>white Peru balsam</i>,
<i>white Indian balsam</i> or <i>liquid ambar</i> is found in commerce
a product similar to storax, which is derived from
<i>Liquidambar styraciflua, L.</i>, a tree indigenous to Mexico
and Louisiana. This balsam forms a clear, transparent,
brownish-yellow, semi-fluid mass. It has a storax-like
odor, and a sharp and pungent taste. It is only
partially soluble in alcohol, specifically lighter than
water, and shows an acid reaction. It is said to consist
of 24 per cent. styracin, 1 per cent. benzoic acid, volatile
oil, etc. It is sometimes used for fumigating purposes,
but chiefly serves for the adulteration of Tolu balsam.</p>

<p><i>Myrrh</i> (<i>Gummi-resina myrrha</i>, <i>Gummi myrrha</i>) is a
gum resin, the produce of <i>Balsamodendron Ehren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>bergianum,
Berg</i>, and, perhaps, also of <i>Balsamodendron
Myrrha, Nees</i>. The first-named tree is found in the
countries bordering on the Red Sea, and extends into
Africa to the Somali Coast, where the principal supply
of myrrh is collected. The gum-resin exudes naturally
as a white oil-like mass, which, after hardening, whereby
it becomes considerably darker, is collected by the natives
and brought chiefly to Berbera, a small seaport opposite
Aden, to be exchanged for English and Indian goods.
From there, by way of Aden and Bombay, it reaches
the European market. In Bombay the first sorting
takes place, which is, however, superficial, and hence
has to be repeated in Europe (London). According to
Parker, ten different resins are admixed with myrrh,
especially bdellium resins.</p>

<p>In commerce <i>Myrrha electa</i> and <i>Myrrha vulgaris</i> or
<i>in sortis</i> are distinguished. <i>Myrrha electa</i>, the best
quality, occurs in pieces of irregular form and variable
sizes, consisting of tears&mdash;either distinct or agglomerated&mdash;usually
covered with a fine powder or dust. The surface
is seldom smooth, but generally rough or granular.
The color varies, being pale reddish-yellow, red, or reddish-brown.
The fracture is conchoidal, seldom smooth,
but rather granular, rough, of a fatty lustre, and sometimes
shows whitish striæ or veins, or opalesces like flint.
The fractured edges are more or less translucent; thin
disks or splinters are translucent or transparent. The
specific gravity is, according to Hager, 1.195 to 1.205,
and according to Ruickholdt, 1.12 to 1.18. A <i>Myrrha
electa</i> is the better, the more fragile, friable, and paler in
color it is, and the more rapidly it ignites and burns
with a yellow, sooty flame. Poorer qualities may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
recognized by the dark-brown color and dirty appearance.
Myrrh is with difficulty rubbed to a fine powder,
this being possible only after drying, which must, however,
be done at a very moderate heat in order to prevent
loss of volatile oil.</p>

<p>According to Hager, myrrh consists in 100 parts of
about 2.5 parts volatile oil (myrrhol), 25 to 35 parts
resin (myrrhin), 55 to 65 parts gum soluble in water,
3 to 8 parts salts, impurities, and water. Water forms
with myrrh an emulsion, and dissolves the gum. The
resinous constituents are dissolved by spirit of wine.</p>

<p>The gum, which forms the portion of the myrrh
soluble in water, but insoluble in alcohol, and amounts
to from 57 to 59 per cent., is, according to Oscar Koehler,
a hydrocarbon of the formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The portion
soluble in alcohol is, according to the same chemist, a
mixture of various resins, an indifferent soft resin of the
formula C<sub>26</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, soluble in alcohol and ether, forming
the greater portion of it. There are further present
two resin acids, one of which has to be considered a
bibasic acid of composition C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and the other as a
monobasic acid of the formula C<sub>26</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>9</sub>. The principal
constituent of the volatile oil of which, according to
Koehler, 7 to 8 per cent. is present, while Ruickholdt
formerly found only 2.18 per cent. corresponds to the
formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O. The volatile oil is laevorotatory, and
when diluted with bisulphide of carbon becomes, according
to Flückiger, violet by the action of bromine. An
extract of myrrh, prepared with bisulphide of carbon,
gives the same reaction with bromine vapor. Hydrochloric
or nitric acid also colors myrrh violet, which
also applies to the volatile oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Petroleum-ether should, at the utmost, take up 6 per
cent. of the myrrh, and the extract must be colorless.</p>

<p>Myrrh is frequently contaminated with bark, which
forms either a film of cork as thick as paper or a crust
of a fibrous and, at the same time, brittle nature. Sand
or small pebbles are also frequently mixed with the
myrrh. Other varieties of gum or gum-resin, which
considerably decrease the value of the product, are often
found in the commercial article, the inferior qualities especially
being adulterated and mixed with dark pieces of
Suakim gum, gum of the plum or cherry tree, bdellium,
and similar substances, which are partially moistened
with myrrh tincture, and scattered over with myrrh
powder. Adulteration with gum-arabic, gum of the
plum or cherry tree, which are coated with alcoholic
myrrh solution, is recognized by the paler lustre, greater
transparency, and mucilaginous taste. Pieces of resin
melt on heating, while myrrh only swells up. Bdellium
is detected by the dark or black-brown color, toughness,
less bitter taste, and by crackling and spitting when held
in the flame of a candle, as well as by the reaction of
myrrh with nitric acid discovered by Bonastre. By mixing
5 cubic centimeters of alcoholic myrrh tincture with
5 to 10 drops of fuming nitric acid, a rose-color coloration
passing into red results. Parker gives the following
method for testing myrrh: Prepare a tincture of 1 part
myrrh and 6 parts spirit of wine. Saturate with this
tincture white filtering paper, allow it to drain off, and
then wrap it around a glass rod moistened with nitric
acid of 1.42 specific gravity. With genuine myrrh the
paper immediately becomes deep yellow-brown and then
black, while the edges of the paper strip appear dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
purple-red. When a few drops of the tincture of myrrh
are allowed to dry in, a transparent residue remains
behind. The tinctures of spurious articles (with the exception
of bissabol) give turbid residues.</p>

<p>Myrrh was already in Moses's time an article used in
the sacrifices of the Israelites. It seems to have been
made use of by Democrates. Dioscorides enumerates
eight varieties of it, and Pliny seven, which he obtained
from Abyssinia. Herodotus and Diodorus
Siculus mention Arabia as the home of the myrrh tree.</p>

<p>In perfumery, myrrh is chiefly used for dentifrices
and fumigating pastilles and essences.</p>

<p><i>Opopanax</i> is the inspissated juice of the root of <i>Opoponax
Chironium, Koch</i>, or <i>Ferula Opoponax, L.</i> It
forms grains or lumps of a red-yellow or brown color,
and has a fracture of a waxy lustre. It can be rubbed
to a gold-yellow powder. It has a strong and peculiar
odor, and a very bitter and balsamic taste. With water
it forms an emulsion, while it is only partially soluble
in spirit of wine. It contains very little volatile oil,
and a resin which melts at 212° F., and is soluble in
ether and aqueous alkalies. It further contains gum,
organic and inorganic salts, and foreign admixtures.
Opopanax is but little used in perfumery. For <i>Extraits</i>
the opopanax oil is better adapted than the tincture prepared
from the gum, the latter coloring the <i>Extrait</i> dark.</p>

<p><i>Olibanum or Frankincense</i> is the inspissated juice of various
varieties of <i>Boswellia</i>, partially indigenous to Africa
and partially to Asia. The pure pieces are pale yellow, seldom
reddish, transparent, or opaque, brittle, covered with
a mealy coating and of a splintery fracture. The specific
gravity of olibanum is 1.22; its odor is slightly balsamic,
and its taste bitter and pungent. It melts only incom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>pletely
when exposed to heat, diffusing an agreeable odor.
It consists in 100 parts of 5 to 7 parts of a clear volatile
oil, boiling at 323.6° F., and of specific gravity 0.86, 56
parts of acid resin, and 30 to 36 parts gum, which corresponds
with gum-arabic. With water it forms a milky
fluid, and is mostly dissolved by spirit of wine. Selected
olibanum (<i>Olibanum electum</i>) is the best commercial variety,
while <i>Olibanum naturale</i>, <i>O. in lacrymis</i>, and <i>O.
in sortis</i>, form darker pieces intermingled with separate
paler grains, and contaminated by pieces of bark, and
wood and sand.</p>

<p>Olibanum is only adulterated with sandarac and
naturally exuded pine resin, inspissated to tears by exposure
to the air. The former is recognized by the
fracture being glassy and transparent, and the latter by
completely dissolving to a clear solution in spirit of wine.</p>

<p>Olibanum serves as an addition to fumigating pastilles,
etc.</p>

<p><i>Sandarac</i> is the resin exuding from the bark of <i>Thuja
articulata, Desf.</i>, or <i>Callitris quadrivalvis, Vent.</i>, which
grows in Barbary. It forms pale yellow, transparent,
brittle grains with a glassy fracture, which have a specific
gravity of 1.06 to 1.09 and fuse readily. Its odor
is slightly balsamic and its taste somewhat bitter. Sandarac
softens at 212° F. and melts at 275° F. It dissolves
in hot absolute alcohol, ether, and amyl alcohol,
is less soluble in chloroform, petroleum-ether, and volatile
oils, and insoluble in benzol. In 90 per cent. alcohol
⅘ of it dissolve; the term <i>sandaracin</i> has been applied
to the insoluble portion. According to Unverdorben,
sandarac consists of three different resins. It
is sometimes employed in fumigating pastilles.</p>

<p class="subh">PERFUME-SUBSTANCES FROM THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.</p>


<p>Musk is a peculiar concrete secretion obtained from
<i>Moschus mochiferus, L.</i>, an animal bearing a close resemblance
to the deer in shape and size, and indigenous
to the high plateaus of Asia. The musk is contained
in an oval, hairy, projecting sac, found only in the
male, situated between the umbilicus and the prepuce.
It is from 2 to 3 inches long and from 1 to 2 broad.</p>

<p>In commerce, several varieties of musk are distinguished,
the principal ones, however, being Tonkin and
Kabardin musk.</p>

<p><i>Tonkin</i>, <i>Thibet</i>, or <i>Oriental musk</i>, <i>Yunnan musk</i> (<i>Moschus
tonquinensis</i>, or <i>orientalis</i>, or <i>transgangetanus</i>) is the
best variety. It comes from China, Tonkin, and Thibet.
It consists of sacs of a puffed-up appearance, more roundish
than longish, varying in size, being at the utmost 1.77
inches long, up to 1.57 inches broad and 0.59 to 1.18
inches thick, and weighing from 8.46 drachms to 1 oz.
9.39 drachms each. The hairy side of the sac is concave
and the other flat. Fig. 21 shows an unshorn
Tonkin musk sac of medium size from the concave or
hairy side and Fig. 22 the same from the side. The
envelop of the sac consists of a double skin, the outer
skin being gray-brown. One side of the sac is covered
with stiff, yellowish hair with red-brown points, gener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>ally
cut short. The original packages, containing usually
24 sacs each, consist of longish, four-cornered
boxes lined with lead-foil and covered outside with
some silken stuff. Each sac is separately wrapped in
tissue paper. The musk-substance appears as a dark
red to black-brown mass intermingled with hair, and
forming roundish grains. The odor is penetrating and
the taste bitter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_21-.jpg" alt="Fig. 21, 22 and 23" />
</div>


<p><i>Kabardin</i>, <i>Siberian</i>, or <i>Russian musk</i> (<i>Moschus sibirius</i>,
or <i>cabardinicus</i>) is a cheaper variety of an inferior quality,
which is brought from Mongolia and Siberia. The
sacs (Fig. 23) are longish, generally pear-shaped, flatter
in proportion to their longitudinal and latitudinal dimensions,
and not of a puffed-up appearance, the surface
being frequently even shrivelled or wrinkled. The outer
skin is denser and harder, and on the convex side covered
with longer hair (up to 0.9 inch long), of nearly a
silver or brownish color. Towards the edge of the sac
the hairs are, however, frequently so trimmed and shorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
as to give the sac a resemblance to the Tonkin article.
The musk-substance inclosed in the sac amounts to from
8.46 drachms to 1 oz. It is somewhat paler, more
brown or yellow-brown, soft, almost unctuous, when
fresh, but after storing, solid or granular-pulverulent,
like ground, burnt coffee. The odor is weak, offensive,
more urinose, resembling that of castor, or horse sweat.</p>

<p><i>Moschus ex vesicis</i> is said to be the musk taken from
Tonkin sacs. As a rule, however, it consists of a mixture
of musk substance taken from good sacs which present
a bad appearance, or have been torn, and from sacs
of an inferior quality, frequently adulterated with foreign
substances, such as dried blood, dung of birds,
weathered bicarbonate of soda, etc.</p>

<p>To open a musk sac, cut it with a sharp penknife
around where the hairless side joints the hairy side, and
empty it by scraping it out upon a sheet of paper. The
membranes and hair are then removed by means of
pincers.</p>

<p>The musk-substance of the Tonkin sacs is generally
a heavy, dry-feeling mass; it is partially intermingled
with and partially enveloped by small, thin, soft, brown,
somewhat transparent membranes and frequently mixed
with small hair. It is partially loose and crummy, and
partially consists of various lumps or grains of the size
of a mustard seed to that of a pea, which are more or
less roundish, more seldom angular, softer or harder
(but can always be readily cut), of a fatty lustre and
black-brown or dark-red color. In fresh sacs, the mass
is frequently soft, and, when bruised, somewhat smeary,
but never unctuous. On rubbing, it becomes paler in
color, and glistening hair-like, paler, gray or whitish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>yellow
particles, sometimes of a crystalline texture,
appear. The odor of the musk substance is peculiar,
strong, and very constant; it is agreeable only when
much diluted.</p>

<p>Musk is not a substance of a constant chemical and
physical constitution, the reason for this being found in
the age and the different foods of the musk animal, the
season in which it is killed, and the degree of dryness
of the musk-substance. Water dissolves &frac34; of good
musk and 90 per cent. alcohol &frac12;. The alcoholic solution
is not precipitated by water. Musk further contains
fat-like substances, wax, gall-substances (together
10 to 12 per cent.), glue-substances and albumen (6 to
9 per cent.), traces of lactic and butyric acids, phosphates,
sulphates and hydrochlorates of the alkalies and alkaline
earths, frequently strong traces of ammonium carbonate
and a volatile oil, further moisture, humus-substance,
and fibrous matter.</p>

<p>Musk, when dried, has a weak odor, which gradually
becomes stronger on moistening. There are several substances
which destroy the musk odor, especially bitter
almonds, camphor, sulphur, acids and sulphates. The
odor adhering to a mortar in which musk has been
rubbed can best be removed by pounding bitter almonds
in it.</p>

<p>Since, on account of the high price of musk, the musk
animal is much hunted, there is a possibility of it becoming
in time extinct. For this reason a substitute
has been long searched for, and is believed to have
been found, especially, in the American musk-rat
(<i>Fiber zibethicus</i>), which is chiefly hunted for its skin.
In this animal the musk is found in two small sacs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
located between the anus and generative organs, and is
emitted when the animal becomes excited. According
to R. S. Cristiani, this musk is invaluable for the
toilet soap industry of America, it being nearly as good
and strong as genuine musk. Cristiani has formerly
used much of it for scenting soaps, powders, etc., but
does not recommend it for essences. When used for
soaps, some time is required for the odor to become refined,
and if a piece of soap scented with it is stored
for a few months, it would, according to Cristiani's
assertion, be difficult even for an expert perfumer to
distinguish the odor from that of genuine Tonkin musk.</p>

<p>As possible substitutes for the musk deer may further
be mentioned a species of rat indigenous to the West
Indies, and an antelope of North Africa. It is also
said that musk derived from the Mississippi alligator
has been brought into commerce. The sacs are said to
be small, the odor somewhat different from that of
genuine musk, resembling that of civet, but suitable for
perfuming purposes.</p>

<p>A process for the preparation of <i>artificial musk</i> has
been patented by Dr. Baur, of Gispersleben. According
to the specification, toluol is mixed with the halogen
compounds of butane and boiled with the addition of
aluminium chloride or aluminium bromide. The product
of the reaction is mixed with water and distilled
with steam. The fraction passing over between 338° and
392° F. is caught and treated with fuming nitric acid
and fuming sulphuric acid. The product obtained is
washed with water and alcohol, and crystallized. The
artificial musk forms an amorphous white powder,
which in time becomes yellow. It is readily soluble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
in 90 per cent. alcohol, but from solutions in weaker
alcohol it again crystallizes out at a cool temperature.
The odor becomes very pronounced after the addition of
5 drops of ammonia to 1 pound of a one per cent.
solution.</p>

<p>This artificial product having been in existence but
for a short time, it is not possible to come to a final conclusion
as to its availability. However, its odor differs
essentially from that of the genuine article, and it can
scarcely be employed for fine extracts; if low enough in
price it might, however, be suitable for soaps and
cheaper perfumes.</p>

<p>Musk is very much adulterated, the Chinese being
adepts in this sophistication. Dried blood, on account
of its resemblance to musk, is among the most common
adulterations, but, besides this, sand, iron filings, hair,
the dung of birds, wax, asphaltum, and many other
substances are introduced. They are mixed with a
small portion of musk, the powerful odor of which is
communicated to the entire mass, and renders the discovery
of the fraud sometimes difficult. The bags containing
the musk should have the characteristics before
described as belonging to the natural sac, and present
no sign of having been opened. One of the grossest
frauds, which is also perpetrated in Europe, consists,
according to Hager, in perforating the musk sac with a
needle, placing it in strong rum or weak spirit of wine,
and, after pressing it with the fingers, washing with spirit
of wine and drying in the air. By this means a tincture
suitable for perfuming purposes is obtained, while the
musk-substance is increased in weight by the absorption
of moisture. Sacs thus treated are, however, readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
recognized, they being, after drying, gnarled and uneven.</p>

<p>Good musk-sacs should yield from 50 to 60 per cent.
of musk. An admixture of blood is detected by the
musk acquiring a putrid odor when moistened with
water. The presence of pieces of metal, pebbles, resin,
etc., is recognized by the naked eye or with the assistance
of a magnifying glass. The microscope reveals, in pure
musk, white and brownish, irregularly-formed grains,
cells, oil drops, and, generally, also fungoid threads.
Genuine musk burns with a white flame and leaves a
gray ash, which should not amount to more than from
5 to 8 per cent.</p>

<p>In perfumery musk is used for soap, sachet powders,
and extracts. By itself it is, however, scarcely employed,
not even for the so-called musk soaps or musk extracts.
It is chiefly valued by the perfumer for its property of
rendering other perfumes used in combination with it
more durable and bringing out their scent. For scenting
soaps the musk must first be prepared. If to be
used for milled soaps, it is triturated in a mortar with
clear sugar, while for cold stirred soaps, weak potash
lye of at the utmost 3° to 5° Bé. is poured over it.
Weak lye makes the odor more pronounced, while strong
lye destroys it.</p>

<p><i>Civet</i> (<i>zibethum</i>) is derived from two animals of the
genus <i>Viverra</i>. The actual civet cat (<i>Viverra civetta, L.</i>)
lives in the hottest parts of Africa from the Guinea Coast
and the Senegal to Abyssinia, where it is carefully bred
for its civet. The product is also obtained from <i>Viverra
zibetha, L.</i>, indigenous to the Moluccas and Philippines.
The civet is secreted in a cavity between the anus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the external genitals, and is scraped out with a spoon.
It is semi-liquid, unctuous, yellowish, becoming brown
and thicker by exposure to the air, of a bitter, disagreeable,
fatty taste, and of a peculiar, urinose, disagreeable
odor, resembling that of musk which becomes agreeable
only when much diluted and mixed with other
perfumes. When ignited it burns with a bright flame,
leaving behind 3 to 4 per cent. of ash. It is insoluble
in water; in spirit of wine it partially dissolves with
difficulty, and with greater ease in warm ether and in
chloroform. It should form a homogeneous, non-crumbling
mass. According to M. Boutron Chalard, it contains
free ammonia, stearin, olein, mucus, resin, a yellow
coloring substance, salts, and a volatile oil, the latter
giving the odor to it. In perfumery, civet is chiefly used
as an addition to other perfumes in order to strengthen
them and make them more constant. It is also employed
for perfuming fine leather articles.</p>

<p><i>Castor</i> or <i>castoreum</i> is a peculiar concrete substance
obtained from <i>Castor fiber</i> or the beaver. In both sexes
between the anus and external genitals
are two pear-shaped sac-like follicles
(Fig. 24) united at their thin ends.
The follicles contain, when fresh, a
semi-liquid substance which becomes
more solid by drying. The castor occurring
in commerce is generally dried
by smoke.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig_24.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 24.</div>
</div>

<p>In commerce two principal varieties
are distinguished: Siberian or Russian
and Canadian, English or American castor, the first
being the most valuable. The length of a Siberian sac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
varies between 2.36 and 4.72 inches, the width between
0.98 and 2.55 inches, and the thickness between 0.78
and 1.57 inches; it weighs from 1.76 to 8.81 ozs. One
of the sacs is generally somewhat smaller than the other.
The exterior skin of the sac is almost smooth and, in a
dry state, dark brown; the interior is dirty yellow, intermixed
with a dense cellular tissue, which envelops the
castor-substance and is grown together with it. In a
dried state, the latter is dark brown, without lustre,
almost friable, of a very strong, peculiar odor, and a
pungent, somewhat bitter, aromatic taste.</p>

<p>The sacs of Canadian castor are smaller than the
Siberian, they being at the utmost 3.15 inches long,
0.98 inch thick, and darker and uneven. The interior
mass is resinous, hard, with a lustrous fracture, red-brown,
and can be readily pulverized. The odor is
weaker, somewhat musty and ammoniacal, and the taste
more bitter and less pungent than that of the Siberian
castor.</p>

<p>Castor is much adulterated&mdash;pebbles, pieces of lead,
dried blood, etc., being frequently found in the sacs.
These frauds can generally be detected in cutting the sac
open. Spurious sacs are said to be frequently found
among the genuine sacs of Canadian castor. These
spurious sacs are prepared by drying a mixture of castor,
resin, dragons' blood, etc., in the scrotum of goats.</p>

<p>In perfumery, castor is now very seldom used, the
perfumers preferring musk and civet, which, certainly,
give a somewhat different scent.</p>

<p><i>Ambergris</i> is a fatty, waxy substance, often found floating
on the sea on the coasts of Arabia, Madagascar, Japan,
etc. It is also found in the cæcum of the sperm whale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
(<i>Physetus macrocephalus, Schow</i>), and is supposed by
some to be a morbid secretion in the urinary bladder.
According to Mr. Beale, it merely consists of the indurated
fæces of the animal, perhaps somewhat altered by
disease. It has a gray-white color, often with a black
streak and a slight agreeable odor, like that of benzoin,
which becomes more pronounced on heating. When
held for some time in the hand it becomes soft and
flexible. It melts at the temperature of boiling water,
and, when more strongly heated, volatilizes in the form
of a white vapor, leaving but slight traces of ash behind.
Its specific gravity is 0.8 to 0.9. It is insoluble in
water, sparingly soluble in cold spirit of wine, and
more readily so in hot spirit of wine, ether and volatile
and fat oils. It is almost completely soluble in absolute
alcohol. Though ambergris crumbles readily, it can
only with difficulty be converted into coarse powder.
With the finger it can be polished like hard soda-soap.</p>

<p>The principal constituent of ambergris is ambrin or
ambrein, a non-saponifiable fat, which, from a saturated
alcoholic solution of ambergris, crystallizes, after standing
for some time, in the form of verrucose, whitish or
lustrous acicular crystals. According to John, ambergris
consists of 85 per cent. ambrin, 12.5 per cent. sweet
balsamic extract, further benzoic acid, sodium chloride,
and 1.5 per cent. insoluble brown residue. When distilled
with water, ambergris yields 13 per cent. of a
volatile oil having an agreeable odor. A red-hot iron
wire readily penetrates ambergris, and from the hole thus
made flows an oily liquid of a strong and agreeable
odor.</p>

<p>On account of its high price, ambergris is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
adulterated, the commercial article being often nothing
but an artificial mixture of benzoin, olibanum, wax, and
flour, with other substances, perfumed with musk. Such
adulterations are detected by the appearance, proportions
of solubility, nature of the fracture and the content of
ash. A small quantity of pure ambergris, exposed to
heat, melts without forming bubbles or scum. It is
easily punctured with a heated needle, which, when
withdrawn, should come out clean and without anything
adhering to it, and the characteristic odor of ambergris
should be immediately evolved. The surface should be
rugged, that with a smooth and uniform surface being
generally factitious.</p>

<p>In perfumery, ambergris is not so much used on
account of its agreeable odor, but rather to make the
perfumes more constant.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2></div>

<p class="subh">ARTIFICIAL PERFUME-MATERIALS.</p>


<p>In speaking of the volatile oils used in perfumery,
two artificial perfume-materials, artificial oils of bitter
almonds and wintergreen have already been mentioned.
There can be no doubt that when the chemical construction
of volatile oils is better known, chemistry will succeed
in preparing still more such combinations, valuable
for perfumery, or in converting cheap volatile oils into
more valuable ones, as has, for instance, been done by
Bouchardat and Lafont, who have successfully converted
oil of turpentine into oil of lemons. These chemists
rectified French oil of turpentine at exactly 311° to
314.6° F., dissolved in the distillate, which amounted
to 120 grammes, an equal quantity (120 grammes) of
glacial acetic acid, cooled the mixture and then carefully
added, so that the temperature never exceeded 104° F.,
88 grammes of crystallized chromic acid dissolved in a
sufficient quantity of acetic acid. Notwithstanding that
the greater portion of the oil of turpentine remained unoxidized,
a thorough reaction took place, and the product
of decomposition proved to be a hydrocarbon, boiling at
from 345.2° to 352.4° F., to which Bouchardat and
Lafont have applied the term "terpilene." The properties
of this hydrocarbon, especially its boiling point,
corresponded with those of oil of lemons, its odor also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
resembling that of the latter, but it contained about one-sixth
cymol which it was impossible to remove. Though
thus far this artificial oil of lemons is of no importance
for perfumery, it is of interest as showing the possibility
of converting one volatile oil into another.</p>

<p>The artificial musk, spoken of under "Musk," cannot
be classed with the previously-mentioned artificial perfumed-materials.
The odoriferous principle of the
natural and artificial musk have nothing in common,
the odor depending not on a common chemical combination.</p>

<p>Besides the artificial perfume-materials already mentioned,
but a few others are employed in perfumery,
viz: <i>Cumarin</i>, <i>heliotropin</i>, <i>vanillin</i>, and <i>nitrobenzol</i>, or
<i>oil of mirbane</i>. Another series of artificial perfume-materials,
the so-called fruit ethers, have also been
recommended for perfumery purposes. Although such
products are sometimes used, their employment is not
advisable, since they produce an irritating effect upon
the bronchial tubes and respiratory organs, and frequently
cause headache.</p>

<p><i>Cumarin.</i>&mdash;The agreeable odor of new-mown hay is
chiefly due to the sweet-scented vernal grass (<i>Anthoxanthum
odoratum, L.</i>). This grass contains an odoriferous
substance, the <i>cumarin</i>. The latter is also found in
many other plants; for instance, in the tonka bean (the
seeds of <i>Dipterix odorata</i>), in the sweet woodruff (<i>Asperula
odorata</i>), and, combined with melilotic acid, in
the melilot (<i>Melilotus officinalis, Descr.</i>).</p>

<p>Cumarin forms small, colorless crystals of a silky
lustre. It is very hard, cracks between the teeth,
shows a smooth fracture, and sinks in water. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
a very agreeable aromatic odor, which, on rubbing the
substance with the fingers, becomes like that of oil of
bitter almonds, and has a bitter, warm, and pungent taste.
When pure it melts at 152.6° F., but when containing
fat, like that separated from tonka beans, at from 104°
to 122° F. Its boiling point lies at 554° F.; it volatilizes,
however, at far lower temperatures, diffusing an
odor resembling that of oil of bitter almonds, and sublimating
in white needles. It is soluble in alcohol,
ether, acetic acid, fat, and volatile oils. Of cold water
(59° F.) 400 parts are, according to Buchner, required
for its solution, but of boiling water only 45 parts.</p>

<p>Tonka beans are the ripe seeds of <i>Dipterix odorata</i>.
They are much used in perfumery on account of their
content of cumarin, and formerly constituted the initial
point for its manufacture. In commerce two varieties
are distinguished, viz., <i>Dutch tonka beans</i>, derived from
<i>Dipterix odorata, Willd.</i>, indigenous to the forests of
Guiana, and <i>English tonka beans</i>, from <i>Dipterix oppositifolia,
Willd.</i>, indigenous to Cayenne.</p>

<p>The Dutch tonka bean is 1.18 to 1.57 inches long,
0.39 to O.59 inch wide, and O.27 to O.43 inch thick. It
is generally slightly curved, provided under the point
with the hilum, and covered with a thin, fragile, brown-black
or black skin of a fatty lustre, upon which small
crystals of cumarin are generally found, so that it appears
coated, especially in the wrinkles, with a whitish
dust. The kernel consists of two yellow-brownish oleiferous
catyledons, between which layers of cumarin are
generally found. The odor is agreeable, resembling
that of melilot, and the taste aromatic bitter. Dutch
tonka beans contain fat, sugar, malic acid, and malate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of lime; further, starch, gum, and 1 to 5 per cent. of
cumarin (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The English tonka beans are
smaller, white-yellowish inside, nearly black outside,
and of inferior quality to the Dutch beans.</p>

<p>From tonka beans, cumarin may be obtained by two
different methods. One method consists in repeatedly
extracting the bruised beans with spirit of wine, distilling
the latter off from the extract, and mixing the residue
with cold water, whereby cumarin contaminated
with fat is precipitated. To remove the fat, bring the
whole to the boiling point, filter the hot solution
through a moist filter upon which the fat is retained,
and allow to cool, whereby the greater portion of the
cumarin crystallizes out; the remaining small portion
is obtained by evaporating the mother-lye.</p>

<p>According to the other method, the bruised tonka
beans are distilled with water. After 24 hours the
greater portion of the cumarin separates in a crystalline
form. The residue remaining in solution can be withdrawn
from the water by shaking with petroleum-ether
and subsequent evaporation of the solvent. From one
pound of good tonka beans, up to 4 drachms of cumarin
may be obtained.</p>

<p>Cumarin is sometimes also obtained by purifying by
recrystallization of the débris found in the original boxes
of tonka beans, which chiefly consists of cumarin.</p>

<p>Perkin has recently succeeded in artificially preparing
cumarin from salicylic acid. By boiling the sodium
salt of the latter in acetic anhydride for a few minutes
and then pouring into water, an oil-like body is separated,
whilst sodium acetate passes into solution. The
former is a mixture of acetic anhydride, salicylic acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and cumarin; in distilling, the latter passes over last
(at 554° F.), and congeals in the receiver to a crystalline
mass.</p>

<p>Cumarin is now synthetically prepared by several
firms, that brought into the market by Schimmel &amp; Co.,
of Leipsic, especially being of excellent quality. Although
artificial cumarin is considerably lower in price
than that obtained from tonka beans, most perfumers
still prefer the extract from tonka beans prepared by
themselves. There is, however, no good reason for this,
since a change in the respective receipts for perfumes
presents no difficulties, 8.46 drachms of cumarin corresponding
to 2.2 lbs. of best tonka beans.</p>

<p><i>Heliotropin</i> or <i>piperonal</i> is of great importance in
the manufacture of perfumes. It forms small, colorless
prismatic crystals, which have an agreeable odor of héliotrope.
Upon the tongue heliotropin produces the same
sensation as oil of peppermint under the same conditions,
the sensation being, however, more lasting. It melts at
about 104° F., and volatilizes at a higher temperature
without leaving a residue. It is soluble in alcohol and
ether, and insoluble in cold water; in hot water it melts
to an oily liquid which floats upon the water.</p>

<p>Exposed to the action of heat and air, heliotropin acquires
an uncomely appearance, balls together and, under
very unfavorable circumstances, turns brown. It is
then entirely decomposed and useless, and, hence, should
be kept in summer in as cool a place as possible. A
temperature of 95° F. has already an injurious effect
upon the perfume, and it is best not to buy it at all in
the hot summer months. To preserve the perfume in
its entire freshness, it is advisable for consumers in hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
climates to at once dissolve the heliotropin in alcohol
and to keep the solution in a cool place.</p>

<p>Pepper serves as the initial point for heliotropin or
piperonal, the white variety being the best for the purpose.
To obtain piperine, contained in varying qualities
(7 to 9 per cent.) in pepper, the latter is repeatedly
extracted with boiling alcohol. The extract is then
evaporated to one-third its volume, or the greater portion
of the alcohol is distilled off, and the resinous mass,
obtained after the addition of water, is repeatedly washed
in water with the addition of a small quantity of potash
or soda lye, dissolved in alcohol and purified by repeated
recrystallization. To convert the white-yellow piperine
thus obtained into potassium piperate it is, together with
equal parts of potassium hydroxide and 5 to 6 parts of
alcohol, kept gently boiling for 24 hours in a well-closed
flask provided with an ascending Liebig cooler. A capacious
flask should be used, as the mass pounds quite
vigorously. After cooling, the precipitate, which is obtained
in yellowish, lustrous lamina, is separated through
a filter from the dark-brown mother-lye, washed with
cold alcohol and several times recrystallized from hot
water. A further discoloration may be effected by the
addition of animal charcoal.</p>

<p>The potassium piperate thus obtained forms nearly
colorless prisms in verucose groups, which, however,
turn yellow when exposed to light. By boiling the
alcoholic mother-lye with ⅓ of the previously used potash-lye,
further small quantities of potassium piperate may
be obtained.</p>

<p>To obtain piperonal from the potassium piperate, dissolve
1 part of the latter in 40 to 50 parts of hot water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and then slowly introduce, with constant stirring, a solution
of 2 parts potassium permanganate in 50 parts of
water. This precaution is absolutely necessary, as otherwise
the piperonal formed would be partially further oxidized
and lost. The paste-like mass formed is passed,
while still hot, through a straining cloth, and the residue
repeatedly washed with boiling water until it shows
nothing more of the characteristic odor of héliotrope.
The wash-waters are combined with the first filtrate,
and subjected to distillation over a free fire.</p>

<p>The first distillates are richest in piperonal, it generally
separating already in the cooler. The fractionally
caught distillate is allowed to stand one or two days in
as cool a place as possible, whereby the greater portion
of the piperonal separates in a crystalline form or in fine
lamina. To obtain the piperonal still remaining dissolved
in the water, the mother-lye, after the separation
of the crystals through a filter, may be repeatedly agitated
with ether, whereby the piperonal dissolves in the
ether. The latter is carefully distilled off at as low a
temperature as possible (104° to 122° F.) in the water-bath
or allowed naturally to evaporate.</p>

<p><i>Vanillin.</i>&mdash;Vanilla is the not entirely ripe, pod-like,
capsular fruit (wrongly called pod), of a tropical orchid
(<i>Vanilla planifolia, Andrews</i>), which is cultivated in
Mexico, the West Indies, and South America. It is
extensively used for flavoring, and its odoriferous substance
is highly valued in perfumery. The cross-section
of the capsule is thick and fleshy, filled with very small,
black, lustrous seeds stuck together by a gummy balsam
with which they are coated. The capsule has a sourish
taste and has no value, the seeds, or rather the balsam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
enveloping the seeds, being the substance on which the
odor and taste of vanilla depend. When the vanilla
fruit becomes ripe, the capsule opens and empties its
content of seeds in the form of a balsam-like mass.</p>

<p>The lustrous black-brown surface of vanilla is
frequently coated with white, delicate crystals, which
were formerly taken for benzoic acid. Bley and Vee
first recognized them as a peculiar substance, which was
further examined by Gobley and Stokkebye. This substance,
to which Gobley applied the term <i>vanillin</i>, is the
chief odoriferous substance of vanilla. It is deposited
upon the vanilla-crystals, when the latter are densely
and closely packed together and for some time exposed
to a heat of about 77° F. Of vanillin, vanilla contains
1.5 to 2.75 per cent.; the Mexican variety containing
1.69 to 1.32 per cent., the Bourbon No. I, 2.48 to 1.91
per cent., Bourbon No. II, 1.55 to 0.75 per cent., and
the Java, 2.75 to 1.56 per cent. It is singular, that the
highly valued Mexican vanilla has, generally speaking,
a lower content of vanillin than the other varieties.</p>

<p>At present, vanillin is prepared artificially. Tiemann
and Harmann first showed that by the oxidation of
coniferin, a glucoside occurring in the cambial sap of the
<i>Coniferæ</i>, a product, perfectly identical with the vanillin
prepared from vanilla, is obtained. The coniferin is
obtained by barking the pine or silver fir, scraping
together the sap under the bark together with a portion
of the liber and pouring it into a vessel. The sap is
then pressed off, boiled to separate the albumin, filtered,
evaporated to one-fifth its volume, and set aside to
crystallize. One hundred quarts of sap are said to yield
from 1 to 2 pounds of coniferin-crystals. By now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
allowing an aqueous coniferin-solution to run into a
heated mixture of 10 parts potassium bichromate, 15
parts concentrated sulphuric acid, and 80 parts water,
and heating for 3 hours in a flask with back-flow cooler,
a liquid is obtained from which ether takes up a yellow
oil. After treating the latter with animal charcoal, dissolving
in ether and evaporating the latter, there remain
colorless, acicular crystals of the odor and taste of
vanilla. These crystals consist of vanillin contaminated
with some vanillic acid. To separate the latter, purify
with acid sodium sulphite and recrystallize. After this
operation, vanillin represents a nearly white crystalline
powder which melts at from 176° to 177.8° F. In
this form it is brought into commerce as a complete substitute
for vanilla, 5.64 drachms of it corresponding to
about 1 pound of vanilla. A medium-sized pine tree
is said to yield vanillin of the value of 80 marks
($19.20).</p>

<p>Vanillin may also be prepared by oxidation from
eugenol. Oil of cloves is diluted with three times its
volume of ether and agitated with weak caustic potash
solution to fix the eugenol on the potash. By acidulating
the alkaline solution and shaking with ether, the
eugenol is collected. After distilling off the ether, the
eugenol is converted with acetic anhydride into aceteugol,
and the latter oxidized with dilute, moderately-warmed
potassium permanganate solution. The filtrate is made
slightly alkaline, concentrated, then compounded with
acid and the vanillin extracted with ether.</p>

<p>Vanillin (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) forms small colorless prisms of a
strong vanilla odor, a warm, vanilla taste, and an acid
reaction. It is readily soluble in hot water, alcohol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
ether, chloroform, fat and volatile oils, as well as in
solutions of caustic alkalies and alkaline carbonates. It
melts when heated to from 176° to 177.8° F.; at a
higher temperature it sublimates without leaving a
residue.</p>

<p>According to a notice published in the "Deutsch-Amerikanischen
Apotheker Zeitung," vanillin adulterated
with benzoic acid has occurred in the United States. A
sample subjected to examination is said to have been
nothing but benzoic acid perfumed with vanillin. Such
an adulteration can be detected with the microscope,
since vanillin crystallizes in acicular crystals, and benzoic
acid in lamina, which can be readily recognized.
Pure vanillin melts at 176° F., while the melting points
of such mixtures are considerably higher, it being in
one case at 249° F. By extracting such mixture with
thin sodium carbonate solution, benzoic acid passes into
solution. After neutralizing with hydrochloric acid, the
filtrate yields with ferric chloride a fawn-brown precipitate
of ferric benzoate, and on adding hydrochloric acid
in excess, the benzoic acid, which dissolves with great
difficulty in cold water, is precipitated. By treating the
latter, or the ferric benzoate, with dilute sulphuric acid
and magnesium, the benzoic acid is reduced to benzaldehyde,
which is recognized by its characteristic odor
of oil of bitter almonds.</p>

<p><i>Nitrobenzol</i> is obtained by treating benzol, or a mixture
of it, with toluol and their higher homologues, with
strong nitric acid, or a mixture of nitric and sulphuric
acids, washing the product of reaction with water and
soda, caustic soda or ammonia, expelling the unaltered
hydrocarbons with steam and rectifying the residue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Three varieties distinguished by their boiling points and
odor occur in commerce. The nitrobenzol or oil of
mirbane (<i>essence de mirbane</i>) is the so-called <i>light nitrobenzol</i>,
which boils at from 401° to 415° F. The
<i>heavier</i> varieties boil at a higher temperature and have
a more or less disagreeable odor; they are used in the
manufacture of aniline and aniline colors.</p>

<p>Pure oil of mirbane is pale yellow, the finest qualities
being colorless and almost as clear as water. It has an
agreeable odor resembling that of oil of bitter almonds,
a specific gravity of 1.186 to 1.2 = 25° Bé., and congeals
at 37.4° F. to a crystalline mass. It is scarcely
soluble in water, sparingly so in alcohol and with difficulty
in watery spirit of wine; it is miscible in all proportions
with ether, benzine, volatile oils, and most fat
oils.</p>

<p>Oil of mirbane is largely manufactured in England,
but the German product is now generally preferred, it
being purer and does not impart to soap perfumed with
it a yellowish tinge. The finest oil of mirbane is prepared
from pure crystallizable benzol, and again purified
by washing with potassium bichromate and sulphuric
acid, and by rectification with steam.</p>

<p>Pure nitrobenzol suffers no change by boiling with
soda lye, while the poorly rectified product colors the
lye yellow or brown.</p>

<p>Nitrobenzol is frequently adulterated with spirit of
wine, which is recognized by shaking the oil with fat
oil of almonds; in the presence of spirit of wine a turbid
mixture is formed. By shaking nitrobenzol containing
spirit of wine with an equal volume of water
in a graduated cylinder, its volume decreases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Oil of mirbane is much used for perfuming soaps, but
even the finest quality of it cannot replace oil of bitter
almonds for fine soaps and perfumery. Great care has
to be exercised in storing, as well as in working, nitrobenzol,
it igniting very readily, and it is also poisonous.
Even the vapors, when inhaled for some time, may produce
symptoms of poisoning, which consist in the skin
acquiring a leaden color, and heavy feelings in the limbs
with cold extremities, especially the hands and feet.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fruit Ethers.</span> At the London Exhibition, in 1851,
various products called apple oil, pear oil, pine-apple oil,
etc., were shown. They were examined by A. W. Hofmann,
and found to consist of solutions of certain ethers
in alcohol. Since then the manufacture has greatly increased
and large quantities are now brought into commerce
under the name of <i>fruit ethers</i> or <i>fruit essences</i>.</p>

<p>Fruit ethers are fluids possessing an agreeable, refreshing
odor closely resembling that of some fruits. For
this reason they are used in confectionery, in the manufacture
of liqueurs and also as a substitute for volatile
oils, in the manufacture of perfumery. Chemically, fruit
ethers are combinations of an organic acid&mdash;acetic, butyric,
valerianic, etc.&mdash;with a so-called alcohol radicle, such
as ethyl and amyl. The preparation of fruit ethers being
connected with many difficulties, is seldom attempted by
perfumers, especially as products of an excellent quality
can at a low rate be procured from chemical laboratories
making a specialty of their manufacture. However, for
the sake of completeness, a brief description of the fabrication
of the principal ethers used in their preparation
shall here be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Acetic amyl ether</i> or <i>amyl acetate</i>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>O.C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O, is
prepared by mixing 1 part of amyl alcohol with 1 part
of concentrated sulphuric acid, and distilling the mixture
with 2 parts of potassium acetate. The distillate
is washed with water, to which some carbonate of soda
has been added, and then rectified over magnesia. It
forms a colorless liquid of an agreeable fruity odor. It
boils, according to Kopp, at 280° F. and, at 59° F., its
specific gravity is 0.8692.</p>

<p>For use in perfumery, the ether is best prepared, according
to Fehling's directions, by heating for some
time at a temperature of 212° F. 1 part of glacial acetic
acid with &frac12; part of sulphuric acid and one part of amyl
alcohol. By then adding water the ether is separated.
By this process distillation is avoided.</p>

<p><i>Acetic ethyl ether</i> or <i>ethyl acetate</i>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O.O.C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.
Acetic ether is formed by the decomposition of sodium
acetate by ethyl sulphuric acid:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>
<p>One molecule of sulphuric acid or 98 parts is mixed
with one molecule of alcohol or 46 parts, or with 1
molecule of alcohol of 90 per cent. which contains 85.75
per cent. of absolute alcohol, hence with 53.6 parts of
alcohol, and distilled with 1 molecule or 82 parts of
anhydrous sodium acetate. Since commercial sulphuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
acid always contains 5 or 6 per cent. of water, this has to be
taken into consideration, and 105 to 106 parts of it have
to be used in order to decompose the entire quantity of
sodium acetate. The crude sodium acetate found in commerce
may be used. It is nearly white and at the utmost
contaminated by traces of sulphuric acid and
chlorine, which in this case are not injurious. The
crystallized salt is heated in an iron kettle whereby it
melts in its water of crystallization. With constant
stirring the water is then completely evaporated until
an entirely dry mass of salt remains behind. The latter
may be quite strongly heated without fear of destroying
the acetic acid. The dried salt is immediately powdered,
passed through a medium fine sieve and kept for use
in well-closed vessels.</p>

<p>On a large scale the distillation of the ether may
be effected in an iron kettle, which is provided with a
well-fitting lid and connected by a copper head with a
cooling apparatus&mdash;a worm lying in cold water. Bring
into the kettle the required quantity of concentrated sulphuric
acid, add, with vigorous stirring, the alcohol and
allow the mixture to rest for 24 hours. Then throw the
dry sodium acetate into the mixture, mix it thoroughly,
by stirring, with the ethyl sulphuric acid, and, after
luting all the joints of the apparatus, heat at first moderately.
Distillation proceeds quietly and uniformly,
the fire being regulated according to how the ether runs
off from the worm. Such uniform distillation is, however,
only attained by the use of the sodium acetate in the
form of powder, and thoroughly mixing it with the acid.
If large pieces of the salt are present or the powdered
salt balls together, the formation of ether sometimes takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
place so suddenly that the vapors cannot condense in the
cooling apparatus, but escape violently, or if they cannot
escape rapidly from the condenser, may even burst the
apparatus. The reason for this is that the larger pieces
float in the superheated acid without being saturated by
it, and, when they suddenly collapse, form a mass of
ether-vapors.</p>

<p>Distillation is continued until that which at last passes
over is not inflammable. With the above-mentioned
proportions 88 parts of acetic ether are formed, but as
some water always passes over, distillation need not be
interrupted until the receiver contains at least 90 parts
of crude ether.</p>

<p>The crude ether always contains more or less water,
some alcohol, and a small quantity of free acetic acid.
With the above-mentioned proportions, the content of
alcohol can, however, be only very small. To neutralize
the acetic acid, add some burnt magnesia or shake with
carbonate of soda solution until the acid reaction disappears.
For the absorption of the water and alcohol, add
as much sharply dried (not fused) calcium chloride as
the fluid will dissolve, and then let it stand with an
excess of the salt for one day. The calcium chloride
combines with the water and alcohol and separates as a
heavy layer beneath the ether. The latter is decanted
off and brought into a rectifying vessel&mdash;a copper still,
heated by steam, and provided with a cooling pipe. The
ether is distilled off at a moderate heat, the last portion,
about 1/10, being caught in a special receiver, to be again
rectified at the next operation.</p>

<p>According to Grossschopf, 40 lbs. of pulverized anhydrous
sodium acetate, together with a cooled mixture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
46 lbs. of concentrated sulphuric acid and 37 lbs. of 95
per cent. alcohol, free from fusel oil, are distilled in a
copper still heated by steam. Distillation is continued
with constant stirring by means of an apparatus in the
still, until no more fluid smelling and tasting of acetic
ether passes over. The crude distillate, amounting to 55
or 56 lbs., is brought into bottles which are filled ⅔ full.
The bottles are then filled up with water and potassium
carbonate is added until the fluid, after shaking, shows
no acid reaction. The aqueous fluid beneath the ether
is then drawn off by means of a siphon, and the ether
several times washed by shaking with water and allowing
to settle. Since the wash-water absorbs a quite considerable
quantity of ether, it is collected and subjected
to rectification, whereby an alcoholic acetic ether is obtained.
The ether, being freed from acetic acid and
alcohol by neutralization and washing, is brought in
contact with fused calcium chloride to free it from
water, and finally rectified over magnesia. In this
manner 36 to 37 lbs. of pure acetic ether are obtained.</p>

<p>Acetic ether is a clear, colorless fluid of a pleasant,
etheral odor. It boils at 170.6° F., and at 59° F. its
specific gravity is 0.9068. Pure acetic ether dissolves
in 11 to 12 parts of water; a content of alcohol or the
addition of water increases its solubility. Hence, its
solubility in water is a criterion of its purity.</p>

<p><i>Benzoic ether</i> or <i>ethyl benzoate</i>, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O.OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, is most
readily prepared by mixing 4 parts of alcohol, 2 parts
of crystallized benzoic acid, and 1 part fuming hydrochloric
acid, and for some time heating the mixture in a
flask. The benzoic acid is thereby gradually and completely
converted into ether. The fluid is mixed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
water, whereby the ether is completely separated. It is
several times washed with carbonate of soda solution,
and, for the purpose of withdrawing the last trace of
free acid, distilled over lead oxide. It forms a colorless
oil of an aromatic odor, specific gravity 1.0502, and
boils at 412° F. In cold water it is insoluble. However,
like all varieties of ether, it dissolves readily in
alcohol and ether.</p>

<p><i>Butyric ethyl ether</i> or <i>ethyl butyrate</i>, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O.OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.
The preparation of this ether must be preceded by that
of butyric acid. The latter is obtained, according to
Bensch, by dissolving 6 lbs. of cane sugar and 8 drachms
of tartaric acid in 13 quarts of hot water, allowing the
liquid to stand a few days and then adding 7 ozs. of old
rotten cheese, which has been stirred up in 4 quarts of
skimmed sour milk and 3 lbs. of finely pulverized chalk.
The mixture must be kept at a uniform temperature of
from 86° to 95° F. for some weeks, from time to time
mixing it by stirring, and replacing the water lost by
evaporation.</p>

<p>By the action of a ferment the sugar is first converted
into lactic acid. In 10 to 12 days the entire mass congeals
to a paste of calcium lactate. By now allowing
fermentation to proceed without interruption, it gradually
enters another stage; gas bubbles consisting of carbonic
acid and hydrogen rise up, until in the course of
5 or 6 weeks the process is finished. This is recognized
by the fluid becoming quiet, no more gas being evolved.
The fluid then contains a solution of calcium lactate,
which is converted into the corresponding sodium salt
by the addition of 8 lbs. of crystallized soda. It is then
filtered and concentrated by evaporation to 5 quarts. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
adding 5&frac12; lbs. of sulphuric acid, diluted with an equal
volume of water, butyric acid is separated as a dark-colored
oily mass.</p>

<p>The crude butyric acid thus obtained and freed from
water by shaking with calcium chloride, is a mixture of
acetic, butyric, and capric acids, but does not contain
propionic and valerianic acids. To obtain from it pure
butyric acid, fractional distillation is required. For
manufacturing on a large scale, a copper distilling apparatus
with silver head and silver cooling pipe is used,
the bulb of a thermometer being placed in the head. In
the first rectification, the receiver is changed after the
thermometer has risen to 311° F.; the portion passing
over between 311° and 329° F. is caught up by itself,
and the receiver being again changed, distillation is continued
until finished. The first distillate contains mostly
acetic acid, besides a small quantity of butyric acid, the
second the greater portion of the butyric acid besides
a little acetic and capric acids, while the third consists
chiefly of capric acid. For preparing butyric ether for
technical purposes, the fraction passing over between
311° and 329° F. is sufficiently pure. To obtain chemically
pure butyric acid, the rectification of the portion
passing over between 311° and 329° F. is in the same
manner repeated, until finally a product with a constant
boiling point at 324.2° F. is obtained.</p>

<p>Butyric acid fermentation proceeds more rapidly by
using, instead of rotten cheese, putrefying meat, and in
place of sugar, starch paste or mashed boiled potatoes,
1 part of meat to 4 parts of starch or a corresponding
quantity of potatoes being employed. The same products
are formed as in the preceding process, but much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
more rapidly, fermentation being finished, according to
Schubert, in 5 to 6 days.</p>

<p>Butyric acid, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O.OH, or C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>COOH, is a liquid
of a very sour taste and odor, and at an intense cold congeals
to a crystalline mass which melts at 32° F. In a
pure state it boils at 324.2° F. It is soluble in water,
but separates again if soluble salts are added to this solution.
Its specific gravity, after being completely freed
from water, is 0.974.</p>

<p>Besides the normal butyric acid, there is known
another one called <i>isobutyric' acid</i> or <i>dimethyl acetic acid</i>.
It is distinguished from the normal acid by being less
soluble in water and by its boiling point, which lies at
309.2° F. It occurs in St. John's bread or carob, in
the volatile oil from <i>Arnica montana</i> and in croton oil.</p>

<p><i>Butyric ether</i> is formed by mixing 2 parts of butyric
acid with 2 parts of alcohol and 1 part of sulphuric
acid. The fluid is heated to 176° F., and, after being
for several hours kept at that temperature, is poured
into cold water, whereby the ether separates as an oily
fluid. It is then separated from the aqueous solution,
washed with water to which some chalk has been added
for the neutralization of the free acid, and finally the
water is withdrawn from the ether by, for several days,
leaving it in contact with calcium chloride. To obtain
it entirely pure, it is only necessary to distil it once. It
forms a clear, very mobile fluid of a pine-apple odor,
and a specific gravity of 0.900. It boils at 249.8° F.</p>

<p>Commercial butyric ether, large quantities of which
are used for the preparation of the so-called <i>pine-apple
ether</i> or <i>essence</i>, is seldom pure, it being generally obtained
from simply rectified butyric acid. According to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
another method, which is, however, not as profitable, it is
obtained by distilling butter-soap with alcohol and sulphuric
acid. For this purpose, bring 20 pounds of
butter-soap, cut up in small pieces, into a distilling apparatus,
pour over it 10 pounds of 90 per cent. alcohol
and heat moderately until the soap is dissolved. Since
a portion of the alcohol evaporates thereby, add 10
pounds more of alcohol and then 20 pounds of sulphuric
acid. On further heating, a fluid of a very agreeable
odor distils over, which is an alcoholic solution of the
ethers of the volatile acids found in butter. Towards
the end of the operation, in consequence of the further
progress of decomposition, a development of sulphurous
acid generally takes place. This is removed from the
distillate by allowing it to remain for several days in
contact with finely-pulverized pyrolusite (peroxide of
manganese) and rectifying over burnt magnesia. In the
first distillation, the heavy volatile acids of the butter
remain behind; they are freed from the excess of sulphuric
acid and the sulphate of sodium or potassium by
washing with hot water, and can be utilized in the
manufacture of soap.</p>

<p>The butyric ether obtained from butter-soap is far
from being pure butyric ether, it containing, besides it,
a mixture of various kinds of ether derived from the
volatile acids&mdash;caproic, capric, and caprylic acids. However,
these varieties of ether possess similar properties
to that of butyric acid; in alcoholic solutions their taste
and odor are nearly alike, and hence can be employed
in this mixture for the preparation of essences of an
agreeable odor and taste.</p>

<p>A suitable material for the preparation of butyric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
ether is also the St. John's bread or carob, the pods of
<i>Silequa dulcis</i>. Redtenbacher established in them the
occurrence of about 2 per cent. butyric acid, which
Gruenzweig later on proved to be isobutyric acid. Besides
butyric acid and other volatile acids, St. John's
bread contains about 40 per cent. of fermentable varieties
of sugar, which can be utilized after their conversion to
butyric acid. For this purpose Stinde has proposed the
following process: Convert the pods together with the
seeds to a coarse powder; bring 100 lbs. of this powder
into a capacious barrel placed in a warm place, and pour
sufficient water of 82.5° F. over it, to form a thin paste;
after 4 to 5 days add 24 lbs. of whiting and await fermentation.
The paste, which gradually becomes thicker,
is from time to time stirred, and, if necessary, a small
quantity of lukewarm water added. In summer fermentation
is finished in six weeks, after which the
preparation of the ether is proceeded with.</p>

<p>For this purpose bring the paste into a still provided
with a steam jacket; the evening before mix 36 lbs. of
concentrated sulphuric acid with 60 lbs. of alcohol of 95
per cent., and add the mixture to the paste in the still;
then lute the joints of the distilling apparatus, and
quickly introduce steam. Distillation soon commences,
and, when once introduced, is continued with a moderate
admission of steam.</p>

<p>The first pound of the distillate is caught by itself,
and, after changing the receiver, distillation is continued
until but little passes over, even with an increased admission
of steam. Thus an abundant yield of alcoholic
butyric ether is obtained. When distillation is finished
20 lbs. more of alcohol may be brought into the still;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the distillate obtained thereby being still rich in butyric
ether.</p>

<p>The St. John's bread used should be of the best
quality, free from worms and mould, as otherwise the
ether would not possess the pure, agreeable odor characteristic
of butyric ether.</p>

<p><i>Formic ethyl ether</i>, or <i>ethyl formate</i>, CHO.OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.&mdash;This
ether is also much manufactured for the preparation
of the so-called essences which are employed for
the purpose of imitating the odor of plants, fruits, etc.
It is formed by the action of formic acid upon alcohol,
or by bringing ethyl sulphuric acid, or a mixture of alcohol
and sulphuric acid, in contact with formates, or
finally by bringing formic acid at the moment of its
formation in contact with alcohol.</p>

<p>The most simple process is that recommended by
Lorin:&mdash;</p>

<p>Into a capacious distilling apparatus connected with
the cooling pipe, so that the distillate constantly flows
back, bring 1 part, by weight, of glycerin of the consistency
of syrup, add &frac14; of its weight of crystallized
oxalic acid and the same quantity of alcohol of 90 to
95 per cent. With moderate heating a vigorous development
of gas soon takes place. The oxalic acid in
contact with the glycerin splits into formic acid and
carbonic acid, according to the following equation:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="center">┌COOH<br />└COOH</td><td align="center">=</td><td align="center">CHO.OH</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">CO<sub>2</sub>.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Oxalic acid.</td><td align="center">&nbsp;</td><td align="center">Formic acid.</td><td align="center">&nbsp;</td><td align="center">Carbonic acid.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>The glycerine does not undergo alteration thereby.
The nascent formic acid converts the alcohol present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
into formic ether, water being separated. When, after
continued heating, the development of carbonic acid
abates, add the same quantities of oxalic acid and alcohol
to the contents of the still, heat again until but little
carbonic acid is evolved, and then add, twice in succession,
the same quantities of oxalic acid and alcohol as
before, until finally as much oxalic acid is consumed as
glycerin has been employed. When the evolution of
carbonic acid ceases, the receiver is reversed and the
ether distilled off. The glycerin remaining behind is
again concentrated to the consistency of syrup, and may
be re-used.</p>

<p>The distillate is freed from free acid by the addition
of magnesia, and the alcohol and water are separated by
shaking with calcium chloride, after which the pure
ether is obtained by rectification.</p>

<p>Formic ether is colorless, thinly-fluid, of a pleasant
smell, specific gravity 0.945, boiling point 130° F.,
soluble in cold water, and miscible in every proportion
with alcohol and ether.</p>

<p><i>Nitrous ether</i>, or <i>ethyl nitrite</i>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.ONO.&mdash;In a pure
state this ether is best prepared according to the method
given by E. Kopp. It consists in bringing equal volumes
of alcohol and ordinary nitric acid together with
copper filings into a distilling apparatus, which is so
arranged that the vapors first pass through a flask filled
with water of 77° F., then through a calcium chloride
tube, and are finally condensed in a receiver surrounded
by snow and common salt. The nitric acid is first decomposed
by the copper, nitrous acid being thereby developed,
which is so transposed that its radicle NO
occupies the position of the typical hydrogen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
alcohol, while the rest of the acid forms water with the
hydrogen of the alcohol. By the reaction such a quantity
of heat is liberated that the process requires assistance
by external heating only towards the end of the
operation. In the receiver is then a pale yellow fluid
having the taste and odor of apples and, at 59° F., a
specific gravity of 0.947. According to Liebig, the
boiling point of nitrous ether lies at 61.5° F.; hence
it can be condensed only by careful cooling, and has to
be kept in glass tubes fused together. In water it is
but sparingly soluble, but readily so in alcohol. By
the addition of water it is separated from the alcoholic
solution.</p>

<p>Mohr has modified Kopp's method as follows: Mix
alcohol of 0.833 specific gravity, water, and nitric acid
of 1.200 specific gravity, each 24 parts and add 4 parts
of copper filings. Of this mixture draw off 24 parts of
distillate, mix the latter with litmus tincture and neutralize
the free acid by adding, drop by drop, solution
of caustic potash or soda until the litmus tincture becomes
blue. Rectify the distillate and catch of it 8
parts. Compound the latter with 16 parts alcohol of
0.833 specific gravity, whereby the product is made equal
to the quantity of alcohol originally used. The product
is kept in glasses holding from 2 to 3 ozs. each. This
alcoholic nitrous ether is of a yellow color, very strong
and has a pure odor.</p>

<p>In England and America, nitrous ether is much used
for aromatizing whiskies and for other purposes. According
to Stinde<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> it is prepared on a large scale as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>A stone-ware flask of at least 120 lbs. capacity, such
as is used for the preparation of chlorine, is so placed
upon a tripod in a sheet-iron cylinder that the neck projects
over the edge of the cylinder. The space between
the flask and the walls of the cylinder is completely filled
with mats or coarse pack-cloth. A steam-pipe enters the
lower part of the cylinder, while a cock placed on the bottom
of the cylinder serves for discharging the condensed
water. The cylinder is closed by a sheet-iron cover provided
in the centre with a hole through which passes the
neck of the flask. The flask is filled with 60 lbs of 90
per cent. alcohol free from fusel oil, to which, in small
portions, 15 lbs. of crude nitric acid of 36° Bé. are added.</p>

<p>The neck of the flask is provided with an exactly-fitting
tube of pure tin. The tube is bent twice at a right
angle, and one end is provided with an annular piece to
prevent it from slipping too far into the interior of the
flask. The joints between the tube and the neck of the
flask are luted with a stiff paste of flaxseed meal, a wet
strip of linen being, for greater security, wrapped over
the cement. The other end of the tin-tube, which here
occupies the place of a still-head, is in the same manner
connected with a long tin-worm lying in a large cooling
vat.</p>

<p>Everything being prepared, but little steam is at first
introduced into the iron cylinder in order to slowly
warm the apparatus. When this is done the admission
of steam is gradually increased. The mats or pack-cloth
placed between the walls of the cylinder and the flask
prevent the latter from bursting, which otherwise might
readily happen. Distillation commences in about ten
minutes. The admission of steam is then moderated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
care being had that the ether passes over in an uninterrupted
stream of the thickness of a goose-quill.</p>

<p>When, with the admission of the same amount of
steam, the distillate commences to run drop by drop, the
steam-cock is closed and the operation interrupted, this
being the case in about six to seven hours.</p>

<p>The next day the flask&mdash;without removing the residue&mdash;is
charged in the same manner. However, the third
day only 30 pounds of alcohol are poured in.</p>

<p>The combined distillates come into a copper still with
double walls, between which steam can be admitted,
and are neutralized with dry calcium hydrate. The
cooling pipe connected with the still consists of tin, and
is provided with a beak dipping into a flask filled half-full
with 4 pounds of alcohol. A slight current of steam
suffices for distillation. The first distillate is dark
yellow, and contains large quantities of aldehyde. Notwithstanding
careful cooling, the vapors can be but incompletely
condensed, and their inhalation has to be
carefully avoided, they producing stupor and headache
as well as inflammation of the eyes. When the distillate
is colorless and shows no reaction with litmus paper,
the receiver is removed and replaced by a large glass
balloon in which the entire distillate is collected. Distillation
must be quickly finished, as otherwise colored
ether is obtained.</p>

<p><i>Valerianic amyl ether</i> or <i>amyl valerate</i>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>O.C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O.</p>

<p>This ether is formed by treating amyl alcohol with
chromic acid. However, besides the ether a large
quantity of valerianic acid is also formed, which has to
be converted by itself into ether.</p>

<p>To prepare the ether bring 5&frac12; parts of powdered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
potassium dichromate together with 5 parts of water
into a distilling apparatus and very gradually add a
mixture of 1 part amyl alcohol and 5 parts concentrated
sulphuric acid. The fluid becomes so strongly heated
that it almost boils. When reaction is finished, heat
and distil off the rest. The distillate consists of two
layers; the lower one being an aqueous solution of
valerianic acid and the upper one a mixture of valerianic
acid and amyl valerate. To separate both, add concentrated
carbonate of soda solution until all the free acid
is neutralized. The oily liquid separating thereby is
the ether. It is separated from the valerianate of
sodium, the latter evaporated to a small volume, and,
after cooling, sufficient sulphuric acid to fix the entire
quantity of the soda is added. The valerianic acid is
thereby separated, and floats upon the solution of the
sodium sulphate. It is separated from the latter, and
1&frac14; parts of it are added to a mixture of &frac34; part of amyl
alcohol and 1 part sulphuric acid and heated to 212° F.
After the addition of water, the apple-ether separates
and only requires washing with water and some sodium
carbonate to yield a pure product.</p>

<p>The separation of the valerianic acid can, however,
be readily avoided. Evaporate the neutral solution of
the valerianate of soda to dryness in the water-bath,
weigh off 1 molecule, or 124 parts, and gently heat
it with a mixture of 1 molecule or 98 parts of sulphuric
acid (on account of the content of water in the commercial
acid, 105 parts of it will have to be taken) and
1 molecule or 88 parts of amyl alcohol.</p>

<p>The ether thus obtained is a fluid, which, in a concentrated
state, does not possess an agreeable odor, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
when mixed with 10 parts of alcohol imparts to the
latter an odor resembling that of apples. It boils at
from 370° to 374° F., and at 64° F. has a specific
gravity of 0.8793.</p>

<p><i>Valerianic ethyl ether</i> closely resembles the amyl ether,
and, like it, is prepared from valerianate of sodium,
ordinary alcohol, and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><i>Apple ether</i> essentially consists of valeric amyl ether,
of which 1 part is dissolved in 6 to 10 parts of strong
alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Apricot ether</i> is butyric ether with some amyl alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Cherry ether</i> is acetic ether with benzoic ether.</p>

<p><i>Pear ether</i> contains acetic amyl ether.</p>

<p><i>Pineapple ether</i> is butyric ether.</p>

<p><i>Strawberry ether</i> is acetic ether with acetic amyl ether
and butyric ether.</p>

<p>The ethers are dissolved in various proportions in
alcohol, according to the intensity of the odor which it
is desired to obtain. The aroma of most of them is
generally increased by a slight addition of chloroform.</p>

<p>For the preparation of different fruit essences Kletzinsky<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>

<p class="subh">ALCOHOLIC PERFUMES.</p>


<p>The alcoholic perfumes, also called "<i lang="fr">Extraits
d'Odeurs</i>," are divided into flower-odors, "<i lang="fr">Extraits aux
fleurs</i>," and into compound odors, "<i lang="fr">Bouquets</i>." The extracts
of French flower pomades form the foundation of
all <i lang="fr">Extraits d'Odeurs</i>, all other additions serving the
purpose of rendering these odors more pronounced and
durable. Hence the art of the perfumer consist in attaining
this object as perfectly as possible by the correct
composition of the perfume-materials at his disposal.
If, for instance, the flower-odor <i>jasmine</i> is to be prepared,
it would not be sufficient to simply use the
alcoholic extract of jasmine-pomade for the purpose,
since the odor of jasmine would soon volatilize in the
air or upon the handkerchief, if the perfumer did not
understand how to prevent it. To prevent the rapid
volatilization of the scent, to retain it or to fix it, extracts
of various perfume-materials, known as tinctures or
extracts are used.</p>

<p>The method of preparing the flower-pomades in
France has already been described on p. 58 <i>et seq.</i> It
need here only be added that, according to their quality,
these pomades are designated by different numbers by
the French manufacturers. There are three qualities,
which by some manufacturers are designated as No. 6,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
No. 18, and No. 30; and by others as No. 12, No. 24
and No. 36, so that No. 6 and No. 12, No. 18 and No.
24, as well as No. 30 and 36 correspond to each other.
Pomades No. 6 or No. 12 are not suitable for the preparation
of extracts, they containing but little actual extract
of flowers, and are generally mixtures touched up with
volatile oils. They are almost exclusively used for hair
pomades, for which they are well adapted. No. 18 or
No. 24 is the quality generally employed by the perfumer
for alcoholic extracts. No. 30 or No. 36 is the
strongest, and, hence, most expensive flower-pomade,
and is used only by a few perfumers who have customers
for the finest qualities of <i lang="fr">Extraits d'Odeurs</i>.</p>

<p>When freshly prepared, the above-mentioned flower
pomades do not possess the fine odor of the respective
flowers, the full aroma being developed only after about
six months. The tin-canisters containing them should be
provided with well-fitting lids and kept in a cool, dry
cellar. Thus stored, flower-pomade keeps for about five
years, with the exception of jasmine and tuberose, which
keep only for about two years.</p>

<p>In order to show how the extraction of flower-pomades
is effected, we will take, as an example, 2 lbs. of French
flower-pomade No. 18 and 3&frac12; quarts of best alcohol.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
This proportion yields a good and sufficiently strong
extract for the preparation of <i>Extraits d'Odeurs</i>. It
must, of course, be suited to the size of the extracting
apparatus, 8 lbs. of flower-pomade and 14 quarts of alcohol
being, for instance, taken, though that depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
on the quantity of the respective extract required by the
perfumer. It is, however, best that the apparatus should
be as completely filled as possible so that it contains but
little air.</p>

<p>The gaining of alcoholic extracts from flower-pomades
is best effected in a special apparatus, one of the
simplest kind for the purpose being shown at Fig. 25.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 25.</div>
<img src="images/fig_25.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It consists of two cylinders, <i>A</i> and <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> of stout sheet-iron
provided with well-fitting lids. Through the centre
of each lid passes a vertical iron shaft <i>a</i> and <i>a<sub>1</sub></i> which
carries in the interior of the apparatus several horizontal
arms <i>b</i>, <i>b<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>b<sub>2</sub></i>. These vertical shafts can be rapidly revolved
by the horizontal shaft <i>c</i>. Before bringing the
flower-pomade into the apparatus, it is melted in the
water-bath at a temperature, which, under no conditions,
should exceed 88.25° F. The alcohol is also heated to
88.25° F. and added to the melted pomade in the appa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ratus.
The arms with which the vertical shaft is provided,
keep the mass in the apparatus in constant
motion and prevent the pomade from settling on the
bottom. The apparatus is arranged to be driven either
by hand or steam, a fly-wheel instead of a pulley, being
in the first case provided at <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>Where the manufacturer has steam-power at his disposal,
the apparatus may be connected with the transmission
and allowed to run for 48 to 60 hours during
working time. After the expiration of this time, proceed
to strain off the finished extract (No. 1) as follows:
Over a clean tin vessel stretch a close, white
linen cloth, and pour the entire contents of the apparatus
upon the latter; the liquid portion runs through
the cloth into the vessel, while the pomade remains
behind upon the cloth. Finally, the cloth is thoroughly
wrung out in order to obtain as much alcoholic extract
from the pomade as possible. Bring the extract, No. 1,
thus obtained into a glass flask, allow it to stand in a
cool cellar for about 48 hours, and then filter it through
paper into another glass bottle. This filtering through
paper is necessary, even if the extract should appear
clear and pure, as, in straining, not only do small particles
of fat pass through the cloth, but are also dissolved in
the extract. By quietly standing in a cool cellar these
particles of fat are separated and appear as white flakes
on the bottom and sides of the flask. At a higher temperature,
these flakes melt and appear as drops of oil
on the bottom of the flask. If filtering were omitted,
these particles of fat would be transferred to the extracts
and thus cause stains upon handkerchiefs, clothing,
etc. If the manufacturer has not a cool cellar at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
disposal, the fatty particles are readily separated by
placing the flasks containing the extract upon ice, and
filtering immediately after separation is complete. The
fat then remains upon the filter.</p>

<p>The pomade remaining upon the straining cloth is,
without being previously melted, returned to the apparatus,
and, after adding the same quantity of alcohol
(3&frac12; quarts to every 2 lbs. of pomade), the mixture is again
worked as previously described. The straining off and
filtering of extract No. 2 is effected in precisely the same
manner as extract No. 1.</p>

<p>The pomade upon the cloth is now brought for the
third time into the apparatus and, after adding 3&frac12; quarts
of alcohol for every 2 lbs. of pomade, subjected to the
same treatment as for extracts Nos. 1 and 2. After
thoroughly wringing out the cloth containing the pomade,
the latter is brought into a clean tin vessel and entirely
melted upon the water-bath. The vessel containing the
melted pomade is placed in a cool cellar and, if after
complete cooling, a liquid appears upon the surface, it
is added to the flask containing extract No. 3. This
extract, No. 3, is used in place of alcohol when preparing,
the next time, extract No. 1 from the same kind
of pomade. In this manner, an extract No. 1 of still
greater strength is obtained, and by treating the pomade
three times with alcohol, it is more completely exhausted.
The exhausted pomade can, in conjunction with fresh
fat, be used for ordinary hair pomades.</p>

<p>Although the extraction of pomades is somewhat
laborious and requires great care, it nevertheless pays
the perfumer.</p>

<p>Beyer frères, of Paris, have essentially improved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
extracting apparatus previously described, the improvement
being shown in Fig. 26. The cylinders <i>A</i> and <i>A<sub>1</sub></i>
are of copper tinned inside; the lids close air-tight;
above the cocks <i>f</i> and <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> a perforated piece of tin is
placed in the interior of the cylinders; upon this piece
of tin a disk of felt may be placed, and thus the extract
be drawn off clear. In order to reduce the pomade
to a finely divided state, and thus bring it in contact
with the alcohol, it is passed through a vermicelli press,
<i>h</i>, placed upon the cylinder <i>A<sub>1</sub></i>. The pomade passes, in
the form of fine vermicelli, through a sieve in the lower
portion of the press into the alcohol contained in the
cylinders. The press can be transferred from one extracting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>vessel to the other. The shafts <i>a</i> and <i>a<sub>1</sub></i> also
have several horizontal arms like those shown in Fig.
25. Through the contrivances <i>d</i> and <i>d<sub>1</sub></i>, sitting upon the
shaft <i>c</i>, the shafts <i>a</i> and <i>a<sub>1</sub></i>, receive a revolving as well
as an up-and-down motion, so that a complete mixture of
pomade and alcohol is effected. By this arrangement
the pomade completely yields its perfume to the alcohol
in one day, and independent of the quicker work, it has
the further advantage that the extracts are of better
quality in consequence of not remaining for so long a
time in contact with the fat.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tinctures and Extracts.</span> In the following pages
receipts for the preparation of the principal tinctures and
extracts used in the preparation of <i>Extraits</i>, as well as
in other branches of perfumery, fumigating pastils and
powders, dentifrices, mouth-waters, and cosmetics, will
be given. The tinctures are prepared from the resins
and balsams previously mentioned, as well as from the
perfume-substances derived from the animal kingdom.
Besides these there are employed for the purpose several
spices, leaves, roots, and seeds&mdash;such as musk-seeds,
angelica root, orris root, patchouli leaves, musk-root
or sumbul-root, tonka beans, vanilla, vitivert root, etc.</p>

<p>Most of these substances, if not already found in commerce
in the form of a powder, are, before extraction,
pulverized, or at least comminuted as much as possible.
For a better view the treatment of each substance is
given with the respective receipt. The infusions should
be stored in a moderately warm room, and thoroughly
shaken several times every day. When extraction is
finished the product is filtered through paper and is then
called <i>tincture</i> or <i>extract</i>.</p>

<p>The substances to be used for tinctures should be fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
and genuine, and the alcohol free from fusel oil, since
a perfect tincture can only be obtained under these conditions.
For the preparation of tinctures Beyer frères
have constructed very suitable apparatuses (Figs. 27
and 28). By the vigorous and uninterrupted agitation
produced by means of such an apparatus extraction is
effected much more rapidly and more completely than
by treating the substances to be extracted in ordinary
bottles and by shaking with the hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 27.</div>
<img src="images/fig_27.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The apparatus (Fig. 27) is provided with two boxes
for the reception of bottles filled with the substances to
be extracted and alcohol. In the accompanying illustration
one box is charged with two glass bottles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the other with a copper flask. However, Beyer frères
also construct apparatuses which can, at one time, be
charged with 6, 8, or 10 glass bottles, so that 6, 8, or 10
different tinctures can be prepared at one operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption">Fig. 28.</div>
<img src="images/fig_28.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The apparatus (Fig. 28) consists of a round table provided
with cavities covered with leather, in which rest
bottles of a special shape. The bottles fit exactly in the
cavities. The stoppers, with which the bottles are
closed, rest against a screw of large diameter placed in
the centre of the apparatus. Against this screw the
bottles are firmly pressed by means of clamps and
screws. The bottles being filled with the substances to
be extracted, the table is set in motion, moving alternately
from left to right and from right to left.</p>

<p>It is advisable to have always a sufficient supply of
tinctures on hand, since their aroma improves by age.</p>

<p>The receipts given in the following pages have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
practically tested and can be recommended as perfectly
reliable.</p>

<p><i>Musk tincture.</i>&mdash;Tonkin musk 11 drachms, rose water
8 ozs., best quality of alcohol 2 quarts.</p>

<p>Carefully empty the musk sac into a glass flask, add
the rose water and let the flask stand for about 10 days,
shaking frequently. Then add the alcohol and let the
whole stand for several weeks, shaking frequently.
Cut up the empty musk sacs into as small pieces as
possible, and, in another bottle, treat them in the same
manner as their contents; distilled water, may, however,
be used instead of rose water. The object of the
water is to soften the musk, which swells up, so that the
alcohol can better penetrate into the cellular tissue and
absorb the aroma.</p>

<p>The extract from the empty musk sacs is used for
cheaper products, or mixed with the extract from the
contents of the sacs, according to whether a more or
less fine quality of tincture is to be obtained. A still
higher yield might, perhaps, be obtained by the use of a
machine for comminuting the musk, which grinds the
sac to atoms, whereby the cellular tissue is still more
completely disintegrated than by cutting up.</p>

<p><i>Civet tincture.</i>&mdash;Civet 5&frac12; drachms, best quality of
alcohol 3 pints.</p>

<p>Civet in its natural state being, with difficulty, soluble
in alcohol, triturate it in a mortar to a pulverulent mass
together with some dry substance, for instance, whiting
or exhausted orris-root powder. The mixture is then
brought into a glass flask, the alcohol added, and the
whole frequently shaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ambergris tincture.</i>&mdash;Ambergris 5&frac12; drachms, alcohol
of the best quality 1 quart.</p>

<p>Ambergris dissolving readily in alcohol, pulverizing
is not required, but if it is done, great care should be
exercised to prevent loss of this expensive substance.
Ambergris is not so much distinguished by its aroma as
by its indestructibility, which renders it especially suitable
for fixing odors.</p>

<p><i>Castor tincture.</i>&mdash;Castor 3&frac12; ozs., best quality of alcohol
3 pints.</p>

<p>Comminute the castor as much as possible, bring it
into a glass flask and add the alcohol.</p>

<p>Perfume-substances resembling musk having in the
last few years increased to an extraordinary degree, the
use of castor has been almost entirely abandoned on
account of its disagreeable odor. The tincture can only
be employed, when very old, for cheap perfumes.</p>

<p><i>Benzoin tincture.</i>&mdash;Benzoin (Siam) 2 lbs., best quality
of alcohol 3 quarts.</p>

<p>Convert the benzoin into a coarse powder, bring it
into a flask, add the alcohol and shake thoroughly.
Solution takes place in 10 to 12 days.</p>

<p>Siam benzoin is the finest and most expensive and is
indispensable for <i lang="fr">Extraits d'Odeurs</i>. For cheaper products
of perfumery, Sumatra benzoin answers very well.</p>

<p><i>Peru-balsam tincture.</i>&mdash;Peru balsam 8 ozs., best quality
of alcohol 5 quarts.</p>

<p><i>Tolu-balsam tincture.</i>&mdash;Tolu balsam 3 lbs., best quality
of alcohol 5 quarts.</p>

<p>Bring the alcohol into a bottle. Tolu balsam cannot
be reduced to a powder, hence it is necessary to keep it
right cool, whereby it becomes brittle so that it can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
cut up with a sharp instrument and a hammer. The
pieces detached are rapidly brought into the alcohol, solution
taking place in about 14 days. If the alcohol
were added to the tolu balsam, the latter would ball
together, rendering solution very difficult. Frequent
vigorous shaking is necessary.</p>

<p><i>Olibanum tincture.</i>&mdash;Olibanum 2 lbs., best quality of
alcohol 4 quarts.</p>

<p>Reduce the olibanum to as fine a powder as possible,
bring it into a flask, add the alcohol and shake frequently.</p>

<p><i>Opopanax tincture.</i>&mdash;Opopanax 2 lbs., best quality of
alcohol 4 quarts.</p>

<p>Reduce the opopanax to a coarse powder, bring it into
a bottle, add the alcohol and shake frequently.</p>

<p><i>Storax tincture.</i>&mdash;<i>Storax liquidus</i> 4 lbs., alcohol of best
quality 5 quarts.</p>

<p>Bring the alcohol first into the flask. Then place the
pot containing the storax in warm water until it becomes
more liquid, and then pour it in very thin threads into
the flask. Shake frequently.</p>

<p><i>Myrrh tincture.</i>&mdash;Myrrh 1 lb., best quality of alcohol
2 quarts.</p>

<p><i>Musk-seed or abelmosk tincture.</i>&mdash;Abelmosk grains 21
ozs., best quality of alcohol 2&frac12; quarts.</p>

<p>Reduce the grains to a fine powder, bring the powder
into a bottle, and add the alcohol. This <i>tincture abelmoschi</i>
fulfils its object as a fixing agent only when
about one year old, when it possesses a very fine aroma.</p>

<p>Abelmosk grains are the seeds of a plant (<i>Abelmoschus
moschatus Mönch</i>; <i>Hebiscus abelmoschus, L.</i>) indigenous
to Central Africa, Arabia, and India. They are reddish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>gray,
kidney-shaped, slightly corrugated on the surface,
and of an agreeable musk-like odor. The substance producing
the musk odor lies in the seed coat. The odor
becomes very pronounced on rubbing the seeds between
the hands.</p>

<p><i>Angelica root tincture.</i>&mdash;Angelica root 16 ozs., best
quality of alcohol 2 quarts.</p>

<p>Bruise or rasp the root, bring it into a bottle, add the
alcohol, and shake frequently.</p>

<p><i>Orris-root tincture.</i>&mdash;Pulverized orris root of best
quality 2 lbs., alcohol of best quality 3 quarts.</p>

<p>Pulverize the root, bring it into a glass flask, and add
the alcohol. The powder having a great tendency to
ball together, it is necessary to shake five or six times
daily, and continue to do so for 14 days. In straining
off the tincture, it is advisable to bring the entire contents
of the flask upon a close linen cloth stretched over
a tin vessel. The orris-root powder remaining upon the
cloth after the tincture has run off is returned to the
flask, and fresh alcohol added in order to obtain a
second extract.</p>

<p><i>Musk-root</i> or <i>sumbul-root tincture</i>.&mdash;Sumbul root 1 lb.,
best quality of alcohol 2&frac12; quarts.</p>

<p>Proceed in the same manner as given under angelica-root
tincture.</p>

<p><i>Tonka-bean tincture.</i>&mdash;Tonka beans 8 ozs., alcohol of
best quality 3 pints.</p>

<p>The tonka bean is of great importance for perfumery.
The tincture prepared from it has an agreeable, penetrating
odor, and in mixing it with other odors, great
care has to be exercised, so that the tonka odor is not
too prominent. The tincture is prepared as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Bring the beans, without comminuting them or removing
the white coating adhering to them, into a flask,
add the alcohol, and let the whole macerate, with frequent
shaking, for about 14 days. Then filter off the
fluid. The tincture prepared in this manner only contains
the cumarin found as a white coating upon the
beans, and is used only for the finest products. Now
take the beans from the flask, comminute them, return
them to the flask, and add 1&frac14; quarts of alcohol. This
extract gives an excellent tincture suitable for products
of medium quality.</p>

<p><i>Cumarin tincture.</i>&mdash;Cumarin 5&frac12; drachms, best quality
of alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Heliotropin tincture.</i>&mdash;The white crystals of heliotropin
yield with alcohol a solution clear as water, which is much
used in the preparation of <i lang="fr">Extrait héliotrope</i>.</p>

<p><i>Vanilla tincture.</i>&mdash;Best quality of Bourbon vanilla
5&frac14; ozs., alcohol of best quality 2 quarts.</p>

<p>To prepare the tincture proceed as follows: Cut the
so-called vanilla pods lengthwise and then into as small
pieces as possible, and bring the latter together with the
alcohol into a flask. Some perfumers triturate the commimuted
vanilla with sugar in a porcelain mortar,
whereby the small-seed bodies contained in the pod
are ground up, and a better yield is claimed to be
obtained. Though by this trituration a tincture of a
darker color may be obtained, the color alone is by no
means a proof of the strength of the tincture. Care
must be had to bring the white, downy crystals of
vanillin found upon the vanilla pods into the flask.</p>

<p><i>Vanillin tincture.</i>&mdash;Vanillin 1&frac12; drachms, alcohol 2
quarts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vitivert tincture.</i>&mdash;Vitivert rhizome 8 ozs., best quality
of alcohol 2 quarts.</p>

<p>Reduce the rhizome to as fine a powder as possible,
bring the latter into a flask, add the alcohol and shake
frequently.</p>

<p><i>Juniper-berry tincture.</i>&mdash;Juniper berries 2 lbs., best
quality of alcohol 5 pints.</p>

<p>The juniper berries (the fruits of <i>Juniperus communis,
L.</i>) are comminuted, and the alcohol is poured over
them.</p>

<p><i>Patchouli extract.</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;Patchouli leaves 1 lb., best quality
of alcohol 5 pints.</p>

<p>Bring the pulverized leaves into a bottle and add the
alcohol. The tincture from patchouli leaves being dark-green
is not suitable for the preparation of <i>Extraits</i>,
since white substances are colored grass-green by it;
only traces of the tincture may be used for the purpose
of giving the <i>Extrait patchouli</i> a greenish shade of color.
The tincture may, however, be utilized for milled
patchouli soaps.</p>

<p>From many of the above-mentioned perfume-substances,
which serve for the preparation of tinctures and
are not entirely soluble in alcohol, but leave a residue
after extraction, a second infusion may be made. Musk,
castor, and the resins dissolve completely, there remaining
behind only the impurities and any mineral constituents
present which possess no aroma. But all
residues from woods, fruits, etc., are suitable for a second
extraction, most of the tinctures thus obtained being
quite aromatic, and, as will be seen later on in giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
receipts, can be very advantageously utilized. For the
second extraction less alcohol has to be taken than for
the first.</p>

<p>Since many perfumers consider it of greater advantage
and more suitable to first dissolve the volatile oils used
for the <i lang="fr">Extraits d'Odeurs</i>, and to prepare a tincture in
this manner, several receipts for the purpose are given
below. In the receipts for perfumery given in the next
following sections, the volatile oils are specified as such,
and not as tinctures, because the <i lang="fr">Extraits d'Odeurs</i>
containing evidently much non-saturated alcohol, the
volatile oils will in time completely dissolve in them.
An exception to this rule might be ylang-ylang oil
and perhaps orris-root oil. Ylang-ylang oil is soluble
with difficulty, even in very strong alcohol, and if
directly used for the <i>Extrait</i>, the latter remains turbid
for weeks, and frequently, especially in winter, does not
become clear, notwithstanding repeated filtering. However,
by preparing in good time an ylang-ylang tincture
this evil is avoided.</p>

<p><i>Almond-oil (bitter) tincture.</i>&mdash;Bitter almond oil 2&frac34;
drachms, alcohol<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Balm-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Balm oil 5&frac12; drachms, alcohol 1
quart.</p>

<p><i>Basil-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Basil oil 14 drachms, alcohol 1
quart.</p>

<p><i>Bergamot-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Bergamot oil 3&frac12; ozs., alcohol
4 quarts.</p>

<p><i>Canango-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Canango oil (Java), 1&frac34; ozs.,
alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cassia-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Cassia oil 1&frac34; ozs., alcohol 1
quart.</p>

<p><i>Cedar-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Cedar oil 1 oz., alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Cinnamon-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Ceylon cinnamon oil 5&frac12;
drachms, alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Citronella-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Citronella oil 1 oz., alcohol 1
quart.</p>

<p><i>Clove-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Oil of cloves 11 drachms, alcohol
1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Eucalyptus-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Eucalyptus oil 1 oz., alcohol
1&frac12; quarts.</p>

<p><i>Geranium-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Palma rosa oil 14 drachms,
alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Lavender-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Lavender oil 1&frac34; ozs., alcohol
1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Lemon-grass-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Lemon-grass oil 1 oz., alcohol

quart.</p>

<p><i>Neroli-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Neroli oil 5&frac12; drachms, alcohol 1
quart.</p>

<p><i>Opopanax-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Opopanax oil 5&frac12; drachms,
alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Orris-root-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Orris-root oil 5&frac12; drachms,
alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Patchouli-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Patchouli oil 5&frac12; drachms,
alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Petit-grain-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Petit-grain oil 11 drachms,
alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Pine-leaf-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Pine-leaf oil<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> 14 drachms,

<p><i>Wintergreen-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Wintergreen oil 5&frac12; drachms,
alcohol 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>Ylang-ylang-oil tincture.</i>&mdash;Ylang-ylang oil 11 drachms,

6&frac12; quarts.</p>

<p>Rose oil, if directly added to the alcohol, dissolves with
difficulty and incompletely. By the following method
the object is, however, readily accomplished:&mdash;</p>

<p>Bring about 5&frac12; ozs. of pulverized sugar into a capacious
porcelain mortar, add the rose oil and mix intimately
with the pestle. Then pour the thickly-fluid
mass through a glass funnel into a glass flask and rinse
the mortar with alcohol until the prescribed 6&frac12; quarts
of the latter have been brought into the flask. Fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>quent
shaking accelerates the complete solution of the
rose oil.</p>

<p>To give the <i>extrait violette</i> an apparently greater concentration,
it is compounded with a green coloring
tincture. The latter may be prepared by bringing comminuted
dried spinach leaves into a bottle and pouring
96 per cent. alcohol over them. The result is a handsome
green coloring matter; but care must be taken not
to add too much of it to the <i>extrait</i>, as otherwise it
might stain the handkerchief, etc.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In compiling the abundant choice of receipts for
<i lang="fr">Extraits d'Odeurs</i> given above, the golden mean has
been chosen in regard to the quality of these odors, they,
when carefully prepared, giving, at a moderate cost of
manufacture, a product which in most cases will satisfy
the demands of lovers of perfumes. To enable the perfumer,
however, to satisfy the highest demands attention
is called to, and a brief explanation given of, the so-called
"<i lang="fr">Extraits triple concentrés</i>."</p>

<p>For the preparation of these stronger products, the
employment of a stronger foundation, <i>i. e.</i>, of more
highly saturated extracts from French flower pomades,
is required. For this purpose the French perfumers prepare,
under No. 30, flower pomades of all odors which
are exclusively used for concentrated <i>Extraits</i>. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
are, of course, correspondingly higher in price than
those prepared from No. 18, which have previously been
treated of.</p>

<p>The method of preparing the extracts from these
pomades, No. 30, is the same as previously described,
the proportion of pomade to alcohol being also the same;
hence for 2 lbs. of pomade 1&frac34; quarts of alcohol are to
be used.</p>

<p>The proportions of volatile oils and tinctures given in
the above receipts are also to be retained. The stronger
extracts from the flower pomades are the only measure
in the preparation of the <i lang="fr">Extraits triple concentrés</i>, and
such must be the case since the object of the concentration
of the <i>Extraits</i> is thus completely attained by the
greater prominence of the flower odors from the <i lang="fr">Extraits
d'Odeurs</i>.</p>

<p>For the preparation of <i lang="fr">Extraits d'Odeurs</i>, the French
perfumers also manufacture a concentrated flower extract
of the various odors. This extract is simply dissolved
in alcohol, the solution being effected immediately, so that
this method of preparing <i lang="fr">Extraits d'Odeurs</i> is the simplest
imaginable. However, the price of such extract (1000
francs = $200 and more per kilogramme = 2.2 lb.) is a
considerable item, so that most perfumers will prefer the
extracts from the flower pomades as previously described.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Extraits d'Odeurs, Quality II.</span>&mdash;In addition to
the <i>fine</i> extracts given in the preceding section, a small
selection of quite cheap receipts for quality II of such
extracts is here given, the extracts No. 2 offering sufficient
material for their preparation. In the introduction
to the previous section, attention has been called to the
fact that quite useful tinctures may be prepared from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
substances leaving behind solid residues, there being also
on hand the second extract from the flower pomades.</p>

<p>Besides the alcohol, such tinctures and extracts cost
only the small trouble of treatment. For this second
quality only half the quantity of volatile oils prescribed
for the best quality is used. Such tinctures, from which
a second extract cannot be had, may, for this purpose, be
diluted one-half with alcohol, which need not be of the
best quality, thus preparing a second quality of them.</p>

<p>The process to be followed is illustrated by a selection
from the first <i>Extrait</i> receipts which have been converted
into <i>Extraits</i> of quality II.</p>

<p><i>Cologne water, eau de Cologne.</i>&mdash;Owing to its excellent
properties, Cologne water is, without doubt, one of the
most popular perfumes. It was invented early in the
eighteenth century, and is perhaps the only perfume
which has kept its reputation for so long a time. It
was formerly employed as a medicine in all imaginable
diseases, and even now is in some cases successfully used
in slight ailments, such as headache, nausea, etc.</p>

<p>The success and reputation of Cologne water are the
natural results of a good product prepared with a
thorough knowledge of the subject. However, in order
to be enabled to impart to Cologne water its generally
known excellent qualities, it is necessary to have a
thorough knowledge of the materials used, as well as
to understand the method of fabrication, and the proper
treatment of all.</p>

<p>For the preparation of actually good Cologne water
employment of the best materials is the first condition.
The alcohol must be pure, <i>i. e.</i>, free from fusel oil, and
95 to 96 per cent. strong, so as to effect a ready and
complete solution of the volatile oils. The latter also
should be of the best quality and proper age, <i>i. e.</i>,
neither too young nor too old. If too young or too
recently distilled, the aroma is not thoroughly de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>veloped,
and if, on the other hand, too old, they have
lost the greater portion of their aroma, are thickly fluid,
acquire a dark coloration, and are finally converted into
a resinous substance in which condition they are entirely
unfit for finer products. A cool and dry cellar is required
for storing volatile oils, and they must also be
protected from air and sunlight.</p>

<p>Regarding the durability of the volatile oils used in
the preparation of Cologne water, the following may be
said:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bergamot oil</i> is quite durable; in well-closed bottles
stored in a cool cellar it keeps quite well for 3 to 4 years.
<i>Oil of lemons</i> is, however, very sensitive, and has to be
especially protected against heat, by which it is readily
decomposed and, so to say, turns sour. Freshly-distilled
<i>neroli oil</i> should never be used, it acquiring its proper
aroma only after being stored for about 2 years; on the
other hand, it should not be too old. When 6 to 8 years
old, it shows a tendency to rancidity, which can, however,
be prevented by mixing it at the proper time with
an equal quantity of alcohol of the best quality. <i>Petit-grain
oil</i> is apt to spoil when kept for several years, and
hence it is not advisable to have too large a supply of it
on hand. Besides the French variety of this volatile
oil, there has existed for several years past another kind,
namely the <i>Paraguay petit-grain oil</i>, which is about
one-half cheaper than the French. While some consider
both oils as equally good, the French product no
doubt deserves the preference. Of <i>lavender oil</i> only the
best French oil, especially made in France for the preparation
of <i lang="fr">Eau de Cologne</i>, should be used. The price
of the English Mitcham lavender oil, being six times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
that of the French oil, is simply excessive. Of <i>rosemary
oil</i>, an especially fine quality for Cologne water, which
can be highly recommended, is also manufactured in
France. Of <i>balm oil</i> only the best German product
should be taken. The three varieties of volatile oils
last mentioned keep for years, especially when kept in
hermetically-closed bottles in a cool place protected from
the sun.</p>

<p>Rose water and orange-blossom water also need careful
treatment, the bottles containing them requiring to be
well stoppered and kept in a cool place. These waters
being liable to spoil, the supply of them should be
renewed from year to year. As regards the compounding
of the volatile oils, it is advisable to mix them in a
capacious glass flask, add at least an equal weight of
alcohol of the best quality, shake thoroughly, let the
mixture stand about 14 days, and then in the apparatus
incorporate it with the required quantity of alcohol.</p>

<p>When the alcohol and volatile oils are intimately
mixed, the mixture is allowed to stand quietly for
about 14 days, when solution of the volatile oils will
be complete. Now add, with vigorous agitation, the rose
water and the orange-blossom water, and let the whole
stand quietly to become clear.</p>

<p>Cologne water thus carefully prepared answers all demands.
Special attention is here called to the fact that
all manipulation by the addition of fixing or conspicuous
substances is injudicious. An addition of tincture of
musk or civet should particularly be avoided. Nervous
people immediately detect such additions, even if present
only in very small quantities, and in most cases refuse
the Cologne water containing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Experience having shown that all alcoholic perfumes
develop their proper aroma only after storing for some
time, provision must be made to have always a sufficient
supply of Cologne water on hand. It is best to keep it
in large glass balloons in a cool cellar. Wooden vessels
are impracticable on account of their permeability and
other evils. Metallic vessels, if used, should be tinned.
Vessels defective in this respect, or tinned with tin containing
lead, exert an injurious effect upon the aroma of
the water. In the latter case, lead is dissolved, even if
only in small quantities, and a dirty precipitate injurious
to the odor of the Cologne water is formed.</p>

<p>The filtering of the Cologne water is best effected
through white filtering paper and a glass funnel; the
paper, however, should not have been bleached with
chlorine, the odor of the latter being readily perceived
and having an injurious effect upon the aroma of the
water. Filtering should be avoided as much as possible
by carefully decanting off the clear water and filtering
the sediment only. Filtering through charcoal, magnesia,
or other clarifying agents, should not be made
use of for fine perfumes, their odor being injured by all
such means.</p>

<p>In the following a selection of receipts for Cologne
water is given; it is, however, especially mentioned that
only good, pure materials must be used even for the
inferior qualities. A receipt for the now fashionable

perfume for toilet purposes, and is used as an addition to
wash-water as well as to baths and for fumigating. On
account of its balsamic constituents, <i lang="fr">eau de Lavande

<p class="subh">DRY PERFUMES.</p>


<p>In ancient times dry perfumes were almost exclusively
used, but, independent of fumigating agents, which will
be considered later on, the consumption of dry or solid
perfumes is at present a limited one. Sachet powders
(<i lang="fr">poudres pour sachets</i>) are, however, still manufactured
in large quantities. The preparation of solid perfumes
with the assistance of paraffine has been recently commenced,
but up to the present time such perfumes have
not become of any importance. Smelling salts may also
be classed among the dry perfumes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sachet Powders.</span>&mdash;Sachet powders (<i lang="fr">poudres pour
sachets</i>) are generally put into silk or satin bags or into
ornamental paper envelopes and are useful for perfuming
clothes, drawers, trunks, desks, letter paper, etc.</p>

<p>The incorporation of the powders with bags or
envelopes is effected by dividing them between thin
layers of cotton, bringing the cotton together with the
powder in fine tissue paper into the shape of the respective
bag, cushion, etc., and then inclosing them in the
bag or envelope.</p>

<p>A selection of receipts for such powders is here given.
Their manufacture is not difficult; however, the weighing
off of the constituents should be conscientiously done,
and in mixing the powders with the volatile oils, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
care should be had not to cause any unnecessary dust
and consequent loss of powder. After mixing, the powder
is passed through a sieve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solid Perfumes with Paraffine.</span> The solid
perfumes simply consist of hard paraffine, which, when
melted, is perfumed with a corresponding quantity of
any desired perfume-essence and poured into moulds.
A few mixtures for such perfumes are here given:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>White rose.</i>&mdash;Rose geranium oil and bergamot oil each
10 drachms, patchouli oil and oil of cloves 1&frac12;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ess-bouquet.</i>&mdash;Coriander oil 1 drachm, oil of cloves
7, nutmeg oil 3.5, lavender oil 10, sandal-wood oil 3.5,
bergamot oil 30, rose oil and rose-geranium oil each 2,
neroli oil 0.6.</p>

<p><i>Lavender odor.</i>&mdash;Lavender oil 50 drachms, bergamot
oil 25, cinnamon oil 0.3, geranium oil 2.5, neroli oil 0.5.</p>

<p><i>Eau de Cologne.</i>&mdash;Bergamot oil and lime oil each 30
drachms, lemon oil and neroli oil each 15, rosemary oil
5, rose geranium oil 0.6.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Smelling Salts.</span> Smelling salts are ammoniacal
perfumes in a solid form, Preston salt (<i lang="fr">sel de Preston</i>)
being one of the most popular. It is generally prepared
by intimately rubbing together in a porcelain mortar
equal parts of sal ammoniac or ammonium carbonate
and lime freshly slaked to a powder, and perfuming the
mixture, according to the quality of volatile salts desired,
with a finer or inferior perfume.</p>

<p>William W. Bartlett prepares Preston salt without
lime according to the following receipt: Powdered chloride
of ammonium 1&frac12; ozs., powdered carbonate of potassium
1 oz. 6 drachms, coarsely powdered carbonate of
ammonium 3 drachms, oils of clove and bergamot each
10 drops.</p>

<p>Mr. Bartlett also gives a formula for a "<i>menthol pungent</i>"
which is quite agreeable to the smell and a novelty
for headache and faintness. It is prepared by leaving
out the essential oils in the above formula and substituting
in their place 1 drachm of menthol.</p>

<p><i>White smelling</i> salt consists essentially of perfumed
carbonate of ammonia. There are several receipts for
it, one frequently used being as follows: Mix in a capacious
porcelain mortar 2.2 lbs. of ammonium carbonate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
with 1.1 lb. of ammonia, cover the mortar and let it
stand quietly. In the course of a few days the contents
have been converted into normal carbonate of ammonia.
The latter is reduced to a coarse powder and perfumed
with bergamot oil 0.56 drachm, lavender oil 0.9,
nutmeg oil, clove oil, and rose oil each 0.28, cinnamon
oil 2.82.</p>

<p>The incorporation of the volatile oils is effected by
first triturating about 1/10 of the salt with the volatile
oils and then gradually incorporating with this perfumed
mass the rest of the salt, a uniform distribution of the
odor being in this manner effected.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2></div>

<p class="subh">FUMIGATING ESSENCES, PASTILLES, POWDERS, ETC.</p>


<p>Fumigating agents are divided into liquid and dry,
the first being alcoholic solutions, and perhaps most
popular. They consist of extractions from resins, balsams,
leaves, flowers, seeds, wood, and roots, compounded
with volatile oils, alcohol, and alcoholic extracts from
French flower pomades.</p>

<p>It should be the aim of the perfumer to compound
these substances so that a harmonious blending together
of all the ingredients is attained. The object of fumigating
living rooms, sleeping rooms, and sick chambers
is not only to make abode in these rooms more agreeable
by an attempt to cover the disagreeable odors, but chiefly
to render them innoxious, thus combining the useful with
the agreeable.</p>

<p>For several years past a strong prejudice against fumigating
has been developed. Such prejudice may be justified
in certain cases, especially when the fumigating agents
contain musk or are otherwise incorrectly composed. An
addition of musk, even in very small quantities, causes
nervous persons to dislike fumigating agents containing
it, because it is a well-known fact that musk excites the
nerves in a high degree, and hence in most cases fumigating
with agents containing it does more harm than good.</p>

<p>The mode of fumigating has also to be taken into con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>sideration.
It is, for instance, entirely incorrect to place
the fumigating agent upon very hot iron, a hot stovepipe,
or glowing coals, because in evaporating upon hot
iron, it leaves behind an empyreumatic, pungent odor
excitatory to cough, while the actual aroma is lost and
thus the object of fumigating is frustrated.</p>

<p>To derive the best effects from the fumigating agent
it should be placed upon a moderately warm article so
that it will slowly evaporate. Liquid fumigating agents
may also be mixed in a porcelain vessel with distilled
water. By placing the vessel upon a warm stove, evaporation
proceeds at a still slower rate, because the fumigating
agent can only evaporate together with the water,
whereby its aroma becomes still more agreeable. The
use of rose water or orange water instead of distilled
water considerably enhances the success of fumigating.</p>

<p>The so-called atomizers may here be mentioned. They
are very practicable for cold fumigating, <i>i. e.</i>, for the distribution
of pine odor, Cologne water, etc. On account
of their content of musk the atomization of <i lang="fr">Extraits
d'Odeurs</i> in the presence of nervous people cannot be
recommended.</p>

<p>The dry fumigating agents, such as powders, pastilles,
paper, and lacquer, are less popular than the fluid, it
being necessary for the purpose of fumigating to place
them upon hot articles, heat them, or burn them. These
manipulations develop more or less smoke, which frequently
exerts a disagreeable effect upon the respiratory
organs. The most injurious of these methods of hot
fumigation is that by means of hot coals, whereby the
aroma of the fumigating agent is largely destroyed, and
the very injurious gas emanating from the coals is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
inhaled. A heated piece of sheet-iron is, however, very
suitable for fumigation by means of powder or lacquer.
Scatter the powder upon it or coat it with the lacquer.</p>

<p>Several approved receipts for liquid and dry fumigating
agents are here given.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fumigating Essences and Vinegars.</span> Great care
should be exercised in making the following receipts for
liquid fumigating agents. After mixing, shake thoroughly,
and let the product stand quietly for at least
several weeks, the aroma of all alcoholic perfumes being
improved by storing for some time. It need scarcely
be said that alcohol of the finest quality is to be used,
since, if it contains fusel oil, the attainment of a fine
product is absolutely impossible. To decrease the cost
of manufacture, it might be permissible to increase the
proportion of alcohol, but an inferior quality of it should,
under no conditions, be employed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fumigating Powders.</span> The lavender flowers, marigold
flowers (<i>Calendula officinalis</i>), rose leaves, etc., used
in the preparation of fumigating powders are not pulverized,
but so far comminuted with a suitable instrument
as to form a distinctly colored mixture. To dissolve
the volatile oils, they are thoroughly mixed with the alcoholic
extracts mentioned in the receipts. The perfume
thus obtained is finally incorporated with the powders
by rubbing together with the hands. To prevent loss
of perfume, it is mixed with the powders in a porcelain
or enamelled vessel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fumigating Paper.</span> Bring into a capacious shallow
dish a quantity of fumigating balsam and repeatedly
draw sheets of card-board through it, allowing the sheets
to thoroughly drain off and dry after each drawing
through. After repeating the operation about four
times, the sheets will be sufficiently perfumed and are
then coated by means of a fine brush with a solution of
gum-arabic in rose water. This gives to the sheets a
dull lustre, while the thin layer of gum-arabic also prevents
the volatilization of the aroma. The sheets thus
perfumed are cut up into pieces the size of a playing
card, and six to twelve such pieces put up in an envelope.
For use the paper is not ignited, but only heated. With
one such piece a room can be several times perfumed.
It may be remarked that before perfuming, the name of
the firm, directions for use, etc., are generally printed
upon the card-board.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fumigating Pastilles.</span> Some perfumers make
more or less a specialty of the manufacture of fumigating
pastilles. They are generally of a red or black color,
different perfumes, names and qualities.</p>

<p>To prepare them, the finely pulverized substances are
passed through a sieve and mixed in a capacious dish
with the volatile oils, tinctures, etc. The mixture of
powder and perfume is then made into a mass with a
mucilage of gum tragacanth, which is thoroughly
kneaded to make it homogeneous.</p>

<p>The saltpetre given in the receipts is dissolved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
itself in distilled water and last of all added to the mass.
Its object is to keep the pastilles burning after ignition.</p>

<p>As regards the mucilage of gum-tragacanth, it may be
said that it readily spoils, especially in summer. When
it begins to get watery it is already useless and soon acquires
a bad odor; by decomposition it loses its cementing
power. Hence only a sufficient quantity for immediate
use should be made at one time.</p>

<p>The moulding of the pastilles is very simple. A number
of tin cones into which the mass is pressed are used
for the purpose. After standing for a short time the
pastilles are taken from the moulds and allowed to dry.</p>

<p><i>Fumigating lacquer.</i>&mdash;Fumigating lacquer consists
chiefly of resins, to which sufficient liquid storax is
added to render the mass plastic, so that sticks of any
desired length and thickness can be formed therefrom.</p>

below are gradually and very carefully melted in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
iron pan over a gas or petroleum flame. To prevent
the resins from scorching, the bottom of the pan must
constantly be kept free with a small iron spatula.
When the mass is perfectly fluid the Frankfort black is
added, and the whole thoroughly worked until no more
lumps of Frankfort black are present. The pan is then
taken from the fire, and, after allowing the mass to
cool somewhat, it is perfumed with the thoroughly
mixed perfume.</p>

<p>A lithographic stone, not too small, is used for giving
the fumigating lacquer a round form. The stone is
rubbed with a rag moistened with a very small quantity
of olive oil. A small portion of the still very warm
mass is then poured upon the stone and rolled with the
hands, which should also be moistened with a little olive
oil, into sticks of desired thickness. The sticks are cut
into the desired lengths while the lacquer is still warm,
and the operation is thus continued until the entire mass
is worked up. The mass in the pan must, of course, be
constantly kept liquid.</p>

<p class="subh">DENTIFRICES, MOUTH-WATERS, ETC.</p>


<p>For cleansing and preserving the teeth and gums,
<i>soaps</i>, <i>powders</i>, and <i>tinctures</i> are used, and for removing
foul breath, <i>mouth-waters</i>.</p>

<p>Great care is required in compounding dentifrices
and mouth-waters, and special attention must be paid
to the correct selection of the material. The substances
used must be chemically pure, and no caustic or sharp
or grating materials, such as pumice, sand, <i>ossa sepiæ</i>,
etc., should be employed, they destroying the enamel of
the teeth.</p>

<p>The coloring substances used to give the dentifrices
and mouth-waters a pleasing appearance should under
no condition be injurious or poisonous, such as, for instance,
brilliant rosa, cinnabar, aniline, chrome yellow,
picric acid, etc. The perfumes have also to be carefully
selected, and all repugnant volatile oils and tinctures,
such as bitter-almond oil, sandal-wood oil, musk tincture,
etc., should be avoided. On the other hand,
peppermint oil forms the principal constituent of the
perfume for most dentifrices and mouth-waters, this
preference being not only due to its agreeable odor, but
chiefly to its pleasant, refreshing, and stimulating action
upon our organs.</p>

<p>In accordance with recent medical directions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
opinions soap is again employed, and justly so, for the
better cleansing of the teeth, whilst formerly it was
generally considered injurious. However, though soap
is innocuous to the teeth, it should be used in very
limited quantities, since its introduction into the mouth
is repugnant to many persons, producing in many cases
vomiting. The quality of the soap must also be taken
into consideration, and only the best neutral soap in the
form of a powder, such as is used for fine milled soaps,
should be employed.</p>

<p>The alcohol used for the tooth and mouth-waters&mdash;more
correctly tinctures&mdash;should be perfectly free from
fusel oil, and of 95 to 96 per cent. strength. The best
qualities of volatile oils should be taken, and the tinctures
prepared with the greatest care.</p>

<p>The dentifrices for preventing caries, among which
the thymol preparations are the most prominent, deserve
special attention. The most celebrated physicians have
long since recognized thymol as an antiseptic, it being
much used in hospitals, and is frequently preferred to
carbolic acid. For this reason thymol preparations should
be used for preserving the teeth. They render good service,
especially in the case of hollow teeth, as they remove
the foul odor and protect the sound teeth from
becoming hollow. For cleansing artificial teeth thymol
tooth-water can be especially recommended. Great care
should, therefore, be exercised in the preparation of these
thymol dentifrices. On the other hand, according to
medical opinions, dentifrices containing salicylic acid
cannot be recommended, the acid, it is claimed, being
very injurious to the enamel of the teeth.</p>

<p>Glycerin, which occurs in several receipts for denti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>frices
and mouth-waters, fulfills a double object; on the
one hand, its action upon the teeth and mouth is beneficial,
and, on the other, it covers the naturally bitter
taste of many substances contained in the preparations,
and thus makes them more agreeable to use.</p>

<p>The receipts for dentifrices and mouth-waters here
given have been thoroughly tested, and can be highly
recommended.</p>

<p><i>Tooth and mouth waters.</i> <i>Thymol tooth-water.</i>&mdash;Alcohol

<p><i>Odontine.</i>&mdash;Exhaust 3 ozs. of pulverized myrrh with
a mixture of 25 ozs. of alcohol and 8 ozs. of water.
Then dissolve 1&frac12; ozs. of Castile soap shavings in a mixture
of 25 ozs. of alcohol and 8 ozs. of water, and
color wine-red with alkannin. Then add lemon oil 30
drops, peppermint oil 30 drops, wintergreen oil 10
drops, star-anise oil 30 drops, and finally 4 ozs. of
glycerin. After allowing the whole to stand in a cool
place for one or two weeks, filter, mix the filtrate with

3&frac12; ozs., myrrh tincture 1.75 ozs., glycerine
of 28° B. 17&frac12; ozs. Proceed as above.</p>

<p>The Peruvian bark-tincture is prepared by macerating
8&frac34; ozs. of Peruvian bark in 1 quart of alcohol of best
quality.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Stahl's tooth-tincture.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best quality 5
quarts, peppermint oil 1&frac34; ozs., clove oil 5&frac12; drachms,

<p><i>Myrrh tooth-tincture.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best quality 1
quart, myrrh tincture 2 quarts, guaiacum-tincture
8&frac34; ozs.</p>

<p>A few remarks may here be made regarding the use
of tooth tinctures. The tinctures should not be used
undiluted, they being apt to make tender gums sore,
cause pain, and may even produce inflammation. It is
best to dilute the tinctures somewhat with water whereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
they become milder and more agreeable to the gums.
An excellent article for rinsing out the mouth is obtained
by pouring a teaspoonful of the tincture into a tumbler
of water.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tooth-Pastes and Tooth-Powders.</span> <i>Tooth-paste
or odontine, No. 1.</i>&mdash;Carbonate of magnesium 6 lbs.,
sugar of milk 2 lbs., precipitated carbonate of calcium
4 lbs., alizarin, to color, 1&frac34; ozs., best soap-powder 7
ozs., powdered gum-arabic 5&frac14; ozs., sugar 17&frac12; ozs. dissolved
in distilled water 2&frac12; quarts, chemically pure
glycerin of 28° B. 17&frac12; ozs., peppermint oil 8&frac34; ozs., clove
oil 8&frac14; drachms.</p>

<p>Pass the magnesia, sugar of milk, carbonate of calcium,
alizarin, soap-powder and gum-arabic through a
fine sieve and mix intimately; dissolve the sugar in the
distilled water and add the glycerin to the solution.
Bring the sifted powders into a mortar or other convenient
vessel, gradually add the fluid and thoroughly
mix with the hands. Then add the perfume, and convert
the whole into a solid paste with a wooden pestle.
Instead of mixing and working the mass in a mortar,
the operation is much more rapidly performed by passing
the mixture through the rolls of a soap mill, which must,
of course, be thoroughly cleansed for the purpose by
washing with water.</p>

<p><i>Tooth-paste or odontine, No. 2.</i>&mdash;Carbonate of magnesium
and sugar of milk each 2 lbs., precipitated carbonate
of calcium 4 lbs., prepared chalk 10 lbs., sugar 4
lbs. dissolved in water 5 quarts, best soap-powder 2 lbs.,
alizarin, as coloring matter, 7 ozs., peppermint oil 10&frac12;
ozs., clove oil 8&frac34; ozs.</p>

<p>This paste is prepared in the same manner as No. 1,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
only the proportion of water has to be taken into consideration.
To prevent the mass from becoming too soft,
the water should be very gradually added.</p>

<p><i>Thymol tooth-paste.</i>&mdash;Carbonate of magnesium 4
lbs., sugar of milk 2 lbs., pulverized gum-arabic and
soap powder each 3&frac12; ozs., carmine nacarat, as coloring
matter, 2&frac34; drachms, and alizarin, as coloring matter, 6&frac34;
drachms, sugar 10&frac12; ozs., dissolved in distilled water 1&frac34;
quarts, peppermint oil 1&frac14; ozs., white thyme oil 2&frac12; ozs.,
crystallized thymol 1&frac14; ozs., arnica tincture 7 ozs. The
thyme oil, peppermint oil and arnica tincture are brought
into a bottle and the thymol is dissolved in the mixture.
By previously converting the thymol to a coarse powder
solution takes place quite rapidly. The further manipulation
is the same as given for tooth-paste No. 1.</p>

<p><i>Cherry tooth-paste.</i>&mdash;Boil briskly 1 oz. potassium
carbonate and 1 oz. of powdered cochineal in a pint of
water until reduced to 12 or 13 ozs. When cold, add 1
oz. cream of tartar, &frac12; oz. alum, 2 ozs. glycerin, and
water sufficient to make 16 ozs. of filtered solution.
Then add 4 ozs. of honey and set aside a few days to see
if fermentation occurs. Carefully mix the liquid with
2 lbs. prepared chalk, 1&frac34; ozs. orris powder and &frac34; ozs.
cassia powder.</p>

<p><i>Non-fermenting cherry tooth-paste.</i>&mdash;Fine powdered
pumice stone 2 ozs., powdered orris root 2 ozs., powdered
myrrh &frac12; oz., honey 4 ozs., sufficient liquid cochineal to

in the necessary quantity of alcohol of best quality.</p>

<p>Thoroughly mix all the ingredients and pass the mixture
through a fine sieve. This tooth-powder should be
used only every 5 or 6 days; when too frequently used
it affects the nerves.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Opiat liquide pour les dents.</i>&mdash;Genuine honey 1&frac12; lbs.,
sugar syrup 2&frac12; ozs., best wheat flour 7 ozs., round-lake
2 ozs., peppermint oil and clove oil each 11&frac14; drachms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Convert the round-lake into a fine powder and pass
it through a fine sieve into a capacious porcelain dish.
Then intimately mix it with the wheat flour, gradually
add the honey and syrup, and after thoroughly working
the mass for about &frac14; hour, add the volatile oil. Now
work the whole thoroughly with the pestle, then cover
the dish, and after allowing it to stand quietly for about
36 hours, bring the mass into boxes of glass or tin provided
with screw-tops.</p>

<p><i>Poudre d' Algerine.</i>&mdash;Cream of tartar and pulverized
red coral each 2 lbs., pulverized burnt alum 1 lb., pulverized
sugar of milk 2 lbs., cochineal as coloring
matter 3&frac12; ozs.</p>

<p>The pulverized ingredients are brought into an enamelled
vessel having a capacity of 12 quarts and
thoroughly mixed, so that the cochineal is uniformly
distributed in the mass. Now have ready about 3 quarts
of nearly boiling water and a thoroughly cleansed soap-stirrer
or similar instrument.</p>

<p>When everything is prepared, quickly pour the hot
water upon the powder in the enamelled vessel and stir
rapidly and thoroughly during the effervescence which
immediately takes place. The effervescence gradually
ceases and the result will be a beautiful crimson colored
mass, the hot water having immediately and completely
dissolved the coloring matter of the cochineal. Now,
bring the mass into a shallow box lined with clean white
paper and place it to dry in an airy room, but do not
expose it to the air or sunlight. The next day the
mass in the box is thoroughly worked through, this
operation being repeated every day until the mass is dry.
It is then again powdered, whereby it acquires a rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
color, and is then sifted. The powder is perfumed with
peppermint oil 1 oz. and clove oil and cassia oil each 5&frac12;
ozs., sufficient glycerin to prevent dust, being at the same
time rubbed in. With the addition of the glycerin the
beautiful crimson color of the powder reappears. This
tooth-powder possesses excellent cleansing qualities and
can be recommended chiefly to persons having yellow
teeth, as well as to smokers whose teeth commence to get
black.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Hufeland's tooth soap.</i>&mdash;Best quality of tallow
melted without acid 14 lbs., soda lye of 38° B. 6&frac12; lbs.,
potash lye of 20° B. 1 lb. Further, yellow ochre 1 lb.,
umber 4&frac12; ozs., and precipitated carbonate of calcium 3
lbs., stirred together with hot water 2 quarts. Peppermint
oil 5&frac14; ozs., clove oil 14 drachms.</p>

<p>The kettle with the tallow strained through a cloth
is brought upon the water-bath and the tallow heated to
167° F. The lye heated to about 100° F. is then slowly
added to the tallow in the kettle, and, after stirring for
about &frac14; hour, the mass is allowed to rest quietly, the
kettle being lightly covered and only a little steam admitted
or fire kept under the kettle, so that saponification
does not take place too rapidly.</p>

<p>Saponification will be slowly effected from the sides of
the kettle in about one hour, the mass in the kettle rising
somewhat. This rising indicates that the process of
saponification is going on. The mass is now again
stirred, which must be done carefully and not hastily, as
otherwise the soap readily becomes spumous. When
the soap again lies quietly in the kettle, it will have the
appearance of a white prime grain-soap. Now add the
coloring substances and the precipitated carbonate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
calcium and thoroughly stir, so that the mass acquires a
uniform brown color. Then remove the kettle from the
water-bath, add the perfumes with constant stirring,
bring the finished tooth soap into the frame, lightly cover
the latter with the wooden lid and let stand over night.
The next day the tooth soap may be cut up into suitable
pieces, which are allowed to dry for about 12 hours and
then packed in tinfoil, etc.</p>

<p><i>Tooth-soap.</i>&mdash;Castile soap 1 lb., prepared chalk 1
oz., thymol 20 grains, oil of wintergreen 30 drops.</p>

<p>Shave the soap into ribbons, beat it into a paste with
a little water, and add first the prepared chalk and lastly
the thymol and wintergreen oil dissolved in a little water.</p>

<p><i>Saponaceous tooth-wash.</i>&mdash;White Castile soap 3 ozs.,
oil of orange peel 10 drops, oil of cinnamon 5 drops,
water 4 ozs., alcohol 12 ozs.</p>

<p>Shave the soap into ribbons; melt with the water in
a water-bath, adding the alcohol while still warm.
Continue the heat if necessary, until solution is effected.
When cold, dissolve the oils in the liquid.</p>

<p class="subh">HAIR POMADES, HAIR OILS, AND HAIR TONICS; HAIR
DYES AND DEPILATORIES.</p>


<p>To properly preserve the hair it requires to be occasionally
oiled, and the scalp to be frequently cleansed.
Pomades and oils serve for the former purpose, and hair
tonics for the latter. For the preparation of pomades,
fats, such as lard, beef-tallow, and beef-marrow, are
principally used, though cocoa butter, cocoanut oil,
castor oil, almond oil, spermaceti, and wax, and, more
recently, vaseline are also employed. For the preparation
of hair oils, fat oils, especially olive oil and almond
oil are used, but also poppy oil, peanut oil, sesame oil,
etc. The fats and oils used should not be rancid, for, on
the one hand, the bad odor arising from rancidity is
troublesome in perfuming, and, on the other, what is of
still greater importance, rancid fat injuriously affects the
scalp and the growth of the hair. Of the oils above
mentioned, which are sometimes used, poppy oil is a
drying oil, and, therefore, not suitable for the purpose.</p>

<p>Some fats enjoy a special reputation as hair pomades,
the property of strengthening the scalp and promoting
the growth of the hair being ascribed to them. This is
especially the case as regards beef marrow and horse
fat,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> whilst in olden times the bone marrow of the deer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
(<i>cerval medullæ</i>) and bear's grease were believed to possess
this property. Cleopatra is said to have used the
latter, and many ladies are at the present time under
the impression that they apply it to their hair when they
use <i lang="fr">Pommade à la graisse d'ours</i>. Thoroughly purified
lard renders no doubt the same service as the above-mentioned
fats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pomades.</span> Pomades are prepared by two different
methods; the desired odor is imparted to the fat by the
extraction of the flowers of various plants, or the fat in
a semi-congealed state is perfumed with different volatile
oils.</p>

<p>The fats used for pomades should, as above indicated,
be as fresh and pure as possible, so that they will keep
for a long time. Fats intended for fine pomades, for
which lard and beef-tallow are chiefly used, are generally
first subjected to purification by, for some time, treating
them with cold water, constantly renewed, and thoroughly
washing, so that all adhering particles of dirt
and mucus are removed, and the pomades prepared from
them are better protected against rancidity. For the
removal of the water adhering from washing, the fats
are remelted. Still greater durability is imparted to
the fat by adding in remelting a small quantity of salicylic
acid (2&frac34; drachms of the acid to 2 lbs. of fat), or of
gum benzoin. A small addition of ethyl nitrite also
renders the fats more durable.</p>

<p>The purification of the fat, which generally consists
of 2 to 3 parts lard and 1 part beef-tallow, is frequently
effected as follows: Boil for about one hour 125 lbs. of
fat with about 30 gallons of water containing 1 lb. each
of common salt and alum in solution, constantly remov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>ing
the scum formed. After standing for several hours,
the fat thus purified is carefully taken off from the sediment
and water; it is then, together with 4 to 6 lbs. of
pulverized benzoin, for some time heated at 167° F., and
finally strained into stone jars, which, after the fat is
cold, are closed with a piece of bladder or waxed paper
and kept for use. Fat thus prepared keeps for years.</p>

<p>For <i>coloring the pomades</i> are used: 1. <i>For red</i>:
Alkannin, cinnabar, carmine (triturated with a small
quantity of sal ammoniac and added to the fat) and
safranin (1 part of it dissolved in 20 parts alcohol and
80 parts water and added to the melted fat). 2. <i>For
yellow</i>: Annotto, turmeric, cadmium sulphide. 3. <i>For
brown</i>: Cocoa powder and ochre. 4. <i>For green</i>: Chlorophyl.
Besides the above-mentioned coloring substances,
a very intense coloring matter for pomades is brought
into commerce under the name "Lederin" by Saltzer &amp;
Voigt, of Oker, Germany. It is manufactured in lemon
color, orange, cinnabar, violet, and brown shades, and 10
to 12 drachms of it, triturated in a porcelain dish with
about 1 lb. of the warm fat, will impart a truly beautiful
color to 100 lbs. of fat or oil.</p>

<p><i>Fine French Pomades</i> (<i>Flower Pomades</i>).&mdash;In France,
especially in the southern part, where the cultivation of
the various flowers, such as roses, violets, mignonette,
héliotrope, etc., is carried on on an extensive scale, the
fine pomades are prepared by the method previously
mentioned (see <a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a> <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>The maceration or extraction of the flowers is effected
as follows: The fat, generally consisting of 3 parts lard
and 1 part beef-tallow, is melted in an enamelled vessel
over the steam or water-bath. The flowers in a clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
linen bag are suspended in the fat, and after covering
the vessel the fat is kept, according to the strength of
the perfume of the respective variety of flower, for a day
or two more at a temperature of from 133° to 145° F.
The extracted and exhausted flowers are then taken out,
slightly pressed out, and thrown away. The same operation
with always the same quantities of fresh flowers
is then repeated ten to twelve times with the same fat,
until it is sufficiently perfumed. The pomade thus
obtained, to which some white vaseline is frequently
added, is then stirred until cold.</p>

<p>Receipts for some flower pomades are here given:&mdash;</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Pommade à la rose.</i>&mdash;Extract, in the manner above
given, with 6 lbs. of lard and 2 lbs. of beef-tallow, both
thoroughly purified, 8 lbs. of fresh rose leaves. Treat
the fat ten to twelve times in the same manner with an
equal quantity of fresh rose leaves.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Pommade à l'acacia.</i>&mdash;Extract 6 lbs. of fresh acacia
flowers with 20 lbs. of fat, and repeat the operation ten
times with a like quantity of fresh flowers.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Pommade à la fleur d'orange.</i>&mdash;Extract 8 lbs. of fresh
orange flowers with 8 lbs. of fat, and repeat the operation
eight times with a like quantity of fresh flowers.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Pommade à l'héliotrope.</i>&mdash;Extract 8 lbs. of fresh héliotrope
flowers with 8 lbs. of fat, and repeat the operation
eight to ten times with an equal quantity of fresh flowers.</p>

<p>All simple French pomades, for which flowers furnish
the perfume, are prepared in a similar manner.
For pomades are chiefly used the flowers of the geranium,
jasmine, mignonette, hyacinth, tuberose, narcissus,
lily, etc., the pomades as a rule receiving the name of the
perfume imparted to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pomades according to the German Method.</span>
Most of the pomades consumed in Germany are
prepared from fresh, purified lard and beef-tallow,
though sometimes additions of wax, spermaceti, stearin,
castor-oil, cocoanut oil, etc., are made, or the pomade is
entirely composed of the latter fats. For inferior
qualities of pomades, borax is much used, since it not
only possesses the property of combining a quantity of
water with the fat, but also makes the pomade more
durable. Soap dissolved in hot water is also often
added to the fat, whereby not only considerable water
is fixed in the pomade, but the latter also becomes very
white and pliant. In regard to pomades containing
borax, it may be mentioned that safranin has proved a
durable substance for coloring the pomades red, while
alkannin suffers alterations.</p>

<p>The fabrication of pomades is very simple. The fat,
after being melted, and somewhat cooled off, is generally
vigorously worked or beaten with a wooden pestle or
spatula, until it acquires a frothy, cream-like appearance.
By this treatment the fat also gains in volume, small air
bubbles being inclosed in it. On the other hand, the fat
is stirred until cold, then perfumed and poured into pots.</p>

<p>The following mixtures of fat may serve as suitable
foundations for white pomades:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Lard 6 lbs., beef-tallow 2 lbs.</p>

<p>II. Lard 6 lbs., beef-tallow 3 lbs.</p>

<p>III. Lard 7&frac12; lbs., spermaceti 1&frac12; lbs.</p>

<p>VII. Lard 6 lbs., cocoanut oil 3 lbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>VIII. Lard 8 lbs., wax 1 lb., cocoa butter 1 lb.</p>

<p>IX. Pomade fat 12 lbs., soap 4 ozs., dissolved in

<p>To either mass given under X, add and combine
thoroughly with it 14 drachms of borax dissolved in 1
quart of water.</p>

<p>The pomades, while still warm, are colored and finally
perfumed. For <i>perfuming</i>, different volatile oils and perfume
substances of suitable composition are used, 1 to 1&frac12;

<p><span class="smcap">Vaseline Pomades.</span>&mdash;Vaseline pomades consisting
neither of an animal nor of a vegetable fat, but almost
entirely of a mineral fat, form a special division of
pomades. On account of its good properties and cheapness,
vaseline, which is obtained from petroleum residues,
etc., has for several years past been much used in
the preparation of pomades. The pomades prepared
from vaseline are not only very suitable for oiling the
hair, as they never become rancid, but may also advantageously
be used as a remedy for chapped skin,
inflammation, cuts, burns, etc. For pomades odorless
vaseline has to be used, 1 lb. of it requiring about 5&frac12; to
8&frac12; drachms of perfume. Lederin, which has been previously
mentioned, is best suited for coloring the pomades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
When used for pomades vaseline, though by itself sufficient
for the purpose, frequently receives an addition of
paraffin, wax (mostly ceresin), and lard. To vaseline
pomades intended for export to warm climates, an addition
of &frac14; to ⅛ceresin is required.</p>

<p>The following mixtures give good foundations for
vaseline pomade:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I. Yellow or white vaseline 2 parts, paraffin 1.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">II. Vaseline 5 parts, paraffin or ceresin 1.</span><br />
III. Vaseline 3 parts, ceresin 1.<br />
IV. Vaseline and lard each 10 parts, ceresin 1.<br />
</p>

<p>The pomades are prepared by first melting the paraffin
or ceresin and then slowly stirring in the vaseline. When
the fat commences to thicken, the perfume is added and
the pomade poured into jars or tin boxes.</p>

<p>A few good receipts for vaseline pomades are here

<p><i>Stick pomades.</i>&mdash;Besides the soft, unctuous pomades
thus far treated of, we have a solid product&mdash;the so-called
stick-pomades. These pomades, which serve for
the better fastening of the hair, are brought into commerce
either as <i>wax pomades</i> or <i>resin pomades</i>, the
former being prepared from a mixture of lard, tallow,
and wax, and the latter from tallow, wax, and resin, to
which some Venetian turpentine may be added.</p>

<p>The following mixtures give good foundations for
stick pomades:&mdash;</p>

<p>The usual process of manufacturing stick-pomade is
as follows: Melt the fat, wax and resin in the water-bath,
then strain the mixture and cool it off by constant
stirring until a thin film is formed upon the surface.
Then perfume and pour into tin moulds of oval, round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
or square form and of various sizes. A dozen of such
tin moulds of the same size are generally soldered
together and are provided below either with a hinged
piece, or they are open. In the latter case they are
placed upon a tin support with a high edge which serves
for the reception for the fat escaping from any of the
moulds. The cold pomades are pushed out by means of
sticks of wood fitting exactly into the moulds. They
are then wrapped in tinfoil, labelled and brought into
commerce.</p>

<p>Stick-pomades are either white, rose color, yellow,
brown or black; alkannin, lederin, umber, Frankfort
black, etc., being used as coloring substances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hair Oils.</span>&mdash;Like pomades, hair oils are perfumed
either with volatile oils or by treatment with larger
quantities of fresh flowers. The oils obtained in the
latter manner are known as <i>Huiles antiques</i>, and are
the finest and most expensive. Vaseline oil, which is
cheap and does not become rancid, is also at present
much used as hair oil. To make the fat oils used as
hair oils more durable and to protect them from becoming
rancid, they are also treated with benzoin. For
this purpose digest for three hours, with frequent stirring,
in the water-bath 100 lbs. of the oil with 1 lb. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
pulverized benzoin. With the exception of alkannin
for red-colored oil and chlorophyl for herb oils, no
coloring substances are used for hair oils. About 5&frac12;
to 8&frac14; drachms of perfume are required for 1 lb. of oil.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Huiles antiques</i> are obtained as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Huile antique à la rose.</i>&mdash;Extract in the cold 1 lb. of
fresh rose leaves with 1 lb. of best olive oil, and with
the oil pressed off, extract, six times in succession, equal
quantities of fresh leaves, leaving the rose-leaves each
time in contact with the oil for 10 to 12 hours. The
oil, when sufficiently perfumed, is filtered.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Huile antique au jasmin.</i>&mdash;Extract in the manner above
given 1 lb. of fresh jasmin flowers with 1 lb. of olive oil.</p>

<p>In the same manner the perfume of the different
flowers can be withdrawn and utilized.</p>

<p>A number of receipts for the most popular hair oils

<p><span class="smcap">Bandolines.</span>&mdash;Bandolines are mucilaginous liquids,
and are prepared from substances forming mucilage,
such as gum-tragacanth, gum-arabic, Japanese gelatine,
quince seeds, flaxseed, etc. Gum-arabic adhering very
firmly, its use, however, cannot be recommended. The
substances above mentioned are heated with water until
the mucilaginous matter is extracted. The latter is then
strained through a cloth, and the mucilaginous, thick,
transparent liquid thus obtained perfumed. Volatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
oils dissolving with difficulty in the liquid, an <i>Extrait</i> is
generally used for perfuming, or an aromatic water for
dissolving the gums. If the bandoline is to be colored,
an ammoniacal carmine solution is to be used. Aniline
colors should not be employed for the purpose, since
they precipitate upon the scalp and hair, even if only
traces of them are present.</p>

<p>Bandolines are not very durable; their keeping properties
may, however, be improved by the addition of
benzoic or boric acid.</p>

<p><i>Rose bandoline.</i>&mdash;Gum-tragacanth 1 lb., rose water
7 lbs.</p>

<p>Bring the pulverized gum-tragacanth into a suitable
earthenware or enamelled vessel, pour the rose water over
it, and let it stand in a right warm place until by the
swelling of the gum a thick mucilage is formed. If
the latter is to remain white, it is first strained through
a coarse linen cloth and then through a finer one; if,
however, the bandoline is to be rose color, triturate in a
mortar 1 to 1&frac12; drachms of best carmine with as little
ammonia as possible, and distribute this coloring matter
in the mucilage. For the reception of the bandoline
jars with a sufficiently wide mouth for the index finger
to reach to the bottom are best.</p>

<p><i>Almond bandoline.</i>&mdash;Allow 5 lbs. of rose water and
1&frac14; ozs. of quince seed to stand, with frequent shaking,
for 24 hours. Then strain and perfume with 2 drachms
of bitter almond oil.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Brilliantine.</span>&mdash;Brilliantine is very popular for giving
lustre to the hair of the head and the beard, and in
fact, if correctly prepared, it has many advantages, since,
owing to its composition, it considerably decreases, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
if it does not entirely prevent, the formation of the annoying
dandruff.</p>

<p><i>Flower brilliantine No. 1.</i>&mdash;Chemically pure glycerin
1&frac12; ozs., alcoholic extract No. 2 from French-flower
pomade No. 24 10&frac12; ozs., French <i lang="fr">huile antique</i> as much
as required.</p>

<p>Vigorously shake the glycerin and alcoholic pomade
extract in a glass flask until a uniform fluid is formed,
which should be clear as water. To give it, however,
an oily appearance, carefully mix with it a little sanders-wood
tincture and turmeric tincture. Fill the
brilliantine glasses half full with the above mixture and
fill up the glasses with French <i lang="fr">huile antique</i> of the same
flower-perfume as the respective alcoholic flower-pomade
extract, but do not shake, this being done only
when used.</p>

<p>Owing to the content of glycerin, which, as well
known, is non-volatile, the consumption of this brilliantine
is very economical, while it is made very agreeable
by the fine French flower perfumes.</p>

<p>If it is desired to prepare the brilliantine at less cost,
pure alcohol may be substituted for the pomade extract
and any perfumed hair oil for the French <i lang="fr">huile antique</i>.</p>

<p><i>Brilliantine No. 2.</i>&mdash;For brilliantine of quality II, the
glasses are first filled half full with perfumed hair oil
and then filled up with non-perfumed alcohol slightly
colored with sanders-wood tincture or turmeric tincture.
Glycerin is not used, and, hence, in this case the oil will
be on the bottom and the alcohol, being lighter, on top.</p>

<p>This brilliantine, containing no glycerin, is not so
economical as the preceding. It evaporates quite rapidly
and sometimes makes the hair hard, especially that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
persons having naturally dry hair. However, this second
quality is also quite popular and the perfumer must satisfy
the demands of his customers as much as possible.</p>

<p><i>Brilliantine No. 3.</i>&mdash;Castor oil 10 lbs., pure alcohol 5
lbs., Portugal oil 7 ozs., clove oil 1&frac34; ozs., petit-grain oil
1 oz., cassia oil 1 oz., citronella oil 11 drachms.</p>

<p>Mix the alcohol and castor oil in a glass-flask, then add
the volatile oils and shake vigorously. If the castor oil
is pure and genuine, it forms an intimate mixture with
the alcohol; if, on the other hand, traces of oil appear
on the surface of the fluid, the castor oil is adulterated
with other fat oils and unsuitable for this purpose. The
castor oil should also be as fresh as possible and, under
no conditions, rancid.</p>

<p>If this brilliantine is desired of a somewhat yellowish
color, the object may be attained by the addition of
sanders-wood tincture or turmeric tincture.</p>

<p>That this brilliantine is of an inferior quality is shown
by its composition. It has the further disadvantage
that it plasters the hair, especially when the castor oil
becomes old. However, there are consumers with
whom this quality is quite popular.</p>

<p>The following formulas for brilliantine are taken from
various sources:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Veal fat 4 ozs., spermaceti 2 ozs., castor oil 12 ozs.,
oil of bitter almonds 1 drop, oil of cloves 10 drops, oil
of bergamot 20 drops. Melt together the first three
ingredients, and add the perfumes when nearly cold.</p>

<p>II. Almond oil 2&frac12; lbs., spermaceti &frac12; lb., oil of lemon
3 ozs. Melt the spermaceti at a low temperature; add
the oil and heat until all flakes disappear. Let the jars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
into which it is to be poured be warm, and then cool as
slowly as possible to insure good crystals.</p>

<p>The following, although somewhat peculiar, is offered
as a good brilliantine:&mdash;</p>

<p>III. Honey 1 fluid oz., glycerin and Cologne water
each &frac12; fluid oz., alcohol 2 fluid ozs. Mix.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hair Tonics.</span>&mdash;Hair tonics serve for cleansing and
invigorating the scalp and for preventing the hair from
falling out. Glycerin having a beneficial effect upon the
scalp is much used as one of the constituents. The tonics
also frequently contain ingredients said to promote the
growth of the hair, such as Peruvian bark extract, quinine,
tincture of cantharides, and substances containing
tannin. Hair tonics containing tincture of cantharides
should, however, not be too frequently used, as otherwise
an excessive stimulation of the scalp might be the
result, which would be more injurious than beneficial to
the growth of the hair.</p>

<p>Some receipts for hair tonics are here given.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Eau Athénienne.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best quality 8 quarts,
vanilla tincture 1&frac14; lb., cumarin tincture 7 ozs., bergamot

three weeks when the distilled water is added and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
whole vigorously agitated. After adding the water the
fluid becomes very turbid and requires several weeks to
clarify. It is then filtered through paper. If, notwithstanding
filtering, it should remain somewhat turbid,
bring a small quantity of carbonate of magnesia upon
the filter.</p>

into a glass balloon and after vigorous agitation allowed
to stand 8 days for the volatile oils to dissolve. The
decoction of Panama wood is then added, next the
bicarbonate of soda solution, and finally the whole is
thoroughly agitated. The Panama-wood decoction
should not be added while hot, as otherwise the glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
balloon might burst. Color the water with cochineal
tincture or henna tincture.</p>

strong, say 1 oz. of best tea (best quality) to 10 ozs. of
boiling water, let stand till cool, strain, and add the
other ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Locock's lotion for the hair.</i>&mdash;Expressed oil of nutmeg
5 fluid ozs., olive oil and stronger water of ammonia
each 20 fluid ozs., spirit of rosemary 40 fluid ozs., rose
water sufficient to make 20 pints. The above should
be mixed with skill, best by gradually pouring the combined

of ammonia, previously diluted with the spirit, and afterwards
slowly incorporating the rose water.</p>

<p><i>Shampoo lotion.</i>&mdash;New England rum 1 pint, bay rum
12 ozs., glycerin 2 ozs., carbonate of ammonium 1 oz.,
borax 2 ozs.</p>

<p><i>Shampoo liquid.</i>&mdash;The readiest agent to produce a good
lather upon the hair of the head is a solution of potassa
or soda or a dilute water of ammonia. The latter, however,
owing to its penetrating odor, is not usually liked.</p>

<p>The following combinations will be found serviceable:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Solution of potassa 4 fluid ozs., borax 1 oz., bay
rum &frac12; fluid oz., tincture of quillaga &frac12; fluid oz., water
enough to make 16 fluid ozs. This may be scented
according to taste.</p>

almond oil 1 drop, rose water 27 fluid ozs. Thoroughly
beat the 3 eggs, and then dilute with the rose water.
Then add the other ingredients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Oil-sugar of cumarin is prepared by triturating 1 part
of cumarin with 999 parts of sugar of milk.</p>

<p><i>Dandruff cures.</i>&mdash;I. Ointment of nitrate of mercury
1 drachm, petrolatum 7 drachms. Mix. Cut the hair
short and keep well brushed, and apply the ointment
every night for a fortnight.</p>

<p>II. Red oxide of mercury 10 grains, ammoniated
mercury 10 grains, petrolatum 1 oz. Mix, and apply
every night.</p>

<p>III. Corrosive sublimate 30 grains, glycerin 5 fluid
ozs., Cologne water 5 fluid ozs., water sufficient to make
15 fluid ozs. Mix to make lotion No. 1.</p>

<p>Beta naphthol 120 grains, alcohol 20 fluid ozs. Mix
to make lotion No. 2.</p>

<p>Salicylic acid 120 grains, compound tincture of benzoin
20 fluid drachms, olive oil 10 fluid ozs. Mix to

<p>Wash the head thoroughly with terebene soap, rinse
well, and dry thoroughly; then rub in some of solution
No. 1 and allow to dry, then use No. 2 in a like manner,
and finally apply No. 3. The treatment should be carried
out daily for a month, and then every alternate day for a
fortnight. The dandruff disappears in a few days, and
the hair in a short time becomes vigorous and supple.</p>

<p><i>Dandruff lotion.</i>&mdash;Chloral hydrate 1 drachm, glycerin
4 drachms, bay rum 8 ozs.</p>

<p><i>Bay rum.</i>&mdash;Genuine bay rum, as brought into commerce
from St. Thomas, is said to be prepared by twice
distilling a fine quality of rum with the leaves and berries
of <i>Myrcia acris</i> or the bayberry tree. The berries are
much richer in volatile oil than the leaves, but on account
of the height of the trees, the gathering of the berries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
is connected with so many difficulties and the harvest so
scanty, that the manufacturers prefer to mix leaves and
berries in a certain proportion.</p>

<p>The following directions for preparing bay rum are
given in Schimmel &amp; Co.'s reports:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Alcohol of 95 per cent. 4 lbs., water 4 lbs., bay oil
5&frac12; drachms, pimento oil 2&frac14; drachms, clove oil 10 drops.
Mix, let stand for several days and filter.</p>

<p>II. Alcohol of 95 per cent. 4 lbs., bay oil 15
drachms.</p>

<p>Mix, let stand for 2 weeks, and then add 8 lbs. of best
Jamaica rum. This bay rum is said to be equal to the
imported.</p>

<p>Another receipt for bay rum is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>III. Alcohol of 95 per cent. 1 quart, rectified spirit
of 60 per cent. 14 quarts, bay oil 1 oz., loaf sugar 4 ozs.</p>

<p>Beat up the sugar with the oil and add the alcohol;
then the spirit, and finally filter.</p>

<p>Mierzinski gives the following formulæ for bay
rum:&mdash;</p>

<p>IV. Alcohol 8 ozs., oil of bay 40 drops, oil of mace
1 grain, oil of orange 20 drops, Jamaica rum 1 oz.,
water enough to make 16 ozs. Digest 2 or 3 weeks, and
filter through magnesia.</p>

<p>V. Alcohol 8 ozs., oil of bay 2 drachms, oil of cloves
1 drop, mace 20 grains, water warmed to 80° F. to
make 12 ozs. Dissolve the oils in the alcohol, digest
the mace in the solution for a few days, filter and add
the water. The whole is allowed to stand, with occasional
agitation, for several days, and filtered through
magnesia.</p>

<p>VI. Jamaica rum 36 ozs., 95 per cent. alcohol 36 ozs.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
oil of bay &frac12; oz., oil of pimento 1 drop, acetic ether 4
drops. Allow to stand at least 3 weeks before using.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hair Dyes.</span>&mdash;The requirements of a good hair-dye
are that it can be readily applied, that it contains no injurious
substances, and that the coloration be as natural
and durable as possible. These demands are difficult to
fulfil, and it cannot be said that there is one of the
ordinary hair dyes which in every respect comes up to
them. Black hair dyes give the most natural coloration,
but the peculiar shade of blue-black hair cannot
be imitated. The medium colors, light brown and
blonde, are the least natural. Most dyes allow of rapid
coloration, though, in order to make the deception more
complete, a gradual coloration is by many persons preferred.
Such gradual, though only very slightly darker
coloration, is attained by the use of hair oils and certain
animal fats containing a slight content of sulphur
or iron, such as freshly expressed egg oil and neat's-foot
oil. It was formerly believed that egg oil, if used in
time, would even prevent the hair from turning gray.
The gradual darkening of the hair may also be effected
by agents, which are converted into colored combinations
only by the atmospheric oxygen or the content of
sulphur in the hair, such as extract from nut shells,
tannin, pyrogallic acid and many metals, the latter
chiefly in the form of pomades or hair oil. Dilute acids
used for some time make the hair somewhat lighter.
Mothers wishing to keep the hair of their children
blonde, avoid oils, and frequently wash the heads of the
children with vinegar or lemon juice. No coloration is,
however, durable; it becomes in the course of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
gradually weaker, and the new growth of hair always
requires after-coloration.</p>

<p>For dyeing the hair metallic salts are chiefly employed.
Owing to their poisonous action the use of <i>lead salts</i>
for the purpose is prohibited in some countries, for
instance, in Germany and Austria. <i>Silver</i> is used in
the form of <i>nitrate of silver</i> (lunar caustic). In the
presence of organic substances, as well as under the influence
of light, this combination is reduced, metallic
silver in small black grains being separated. Silver
salts also give a black precipitate of silver sulphide with
sulphuretted hydrogen. By simply moistening the hair
with silver solution they become brown to brown-black,
the coloration appearing more rapidly by previously
treating the hair with pyrogallic acid, or, after the application
of the silver solution, with sulphydrate of
sodium or potassium. The colorations produced with
nitrate of silver are very durable, but, if not dyed again
for some time, the hair acquires a greenish or reddish
color, this being especially the case if they were not
sufficiently freed from fat before dyeing. For freeing
the hair from fat, wash the hair with a mixture of 1 part
spirit of sal ammonia in 10 parts of brandy, and dry
carefully.</p>

<p><i>Copper salts</i> with certain substances, such as potassium
ferrocyanide solution, potassium sulphydrate, calcium
sulphydrate, and pyrogallic acid give dark-brown colorations.
Of the copper salts, the sulphate in ammoniacal
solution is most frequently employed, though occasionally
also the chloride. These salts give a beautiful
brown color to the hair. Small quantities of copper salt
are also frequently added to the actual black dyes; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
hair by this means acquiring a brown-black, instead of a
deep black color.</p>

<p>All the <i>iron salts</i>, with the exception of the chloride,
may be used for dyeing the hair. Soluble iron salts by
themselves make the hair somewhat darker, but this
slow, natural process is not relied on, and a second substance
forming dark colored combinations with the iron,
such as sulphur, tannin, or pyrogallic acid, is, as a rule,
employed. To this class belongs a <i>Turkish hair dye</i>,
which, according to X. Landerer, is prepared as follows:
Gall-nuts converted to a fine powder are mixed with oil
and roasted in a pan until no more empyreumatic vapors
and odor are evolved. The black powder thus obtained
is made into a paste with water, and into it is stirred a
finely pulverized mass prepared from ferrous oxide,
copper, and antimony, the result being a deep black
mass. This dye is called <i>Rastikopetra</i> (eyebrow-stone).
It is one of the Oriental cosmetics used by
both men and women.</p>

<p><i>Potassium permanganate solution</i> is reduced by organic
substances, peroxide of manganese being formed.
A concentrated solution of this salt imparts to the hair
and skin an intense brown color, which, however, is not
very durable, and requires frequent renewing.</p>

<p><i>Pyrogallic acid</i> may be used for darkening the hair,
not only in combination with metallic substances, but
also by itself, or with alkalies. Hair moistened with
pyrogallic acid becomes under the influence of light and
air dark gray to blackish. However, the color is not
handsome, and appears only in the course of weeks. In
connection with alkalies, pyrogallic acid produces a red-brown
to black-brown coloration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the name of <i>Kohol</i>, an extremely fine powder,
consisting of black sulphide of antimony, is used in
Egypt by all classes for blackening the edges of the eyelids
and the eyebrows.</p>

<p>A hair dye, much used in the Orient, is <i>henna</i>, the
dried and pulverized leaves of <i>Lawsonia inermis</i>. By
the women this powder is used for coloring the hair and
nails red-brown. In the Turkish sweating baths the
attendants scatter the henna upon the hair of the women
and tie it upon the finger nails. The women then frequently
remain for hours in the steam bath, whereby the
powdered henna is converted into an extract-like mass
which colors hair and nails red-brown. It is said that
henna even colors the coal-black hair of the Arabs red-brown,
which is considered beautiful. Before treating
with henna, the hair must be freed from fat with soap
or fuller's earth.</p>

<p>Hair dyed red with henna acquires a beautiful black
color when subsequently treated with indigo, this mode
of dyeing black being much in vogue in the Orient.
The process is as follows: The hair, being freed from
fat with soap, is divided into separate strands and
anointed with quite a stiff paste prepared from pulverized
henna and lukewarm water. The hair, after being
smoothed, is allowed to remain for at least one hour in
contact with the paste, and is then rinsed off with lukewarm
water. Being slightly dried, it is then in the
same manner anointed with a paste prepared from indigo
and water, and allowed to remain in contact with it for
one hour. The hairs which were colored orange-red by
the henna, now have a greenish-black appearance, but
by the oxidation of the indigo in a short time acquire an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
intensely blue-black color, which is extraordinarily
durable, the hair only after several months requiring to
be again dyed.</p>

<p>The freshly expressed juice and the fresh parenchyma
of <i>green walnut shells</i>, or of unripe walnuts, gradually
color light or gray hair dark to nut-brown. The coloring
substance is not thoroughly known, but is very
likely a phloroglucide; it is extracted by fats and alcohol,
but, according to Paschkis, is no longer effective in such
solution. This, however, is not correct in regard to the
alcoholic extract, because the extract from ordinary walnut
shells, prepared by mixing the expressed juice of
green walnut shells with 10 parts of alcohol, allowing
the mixture to stand for ten days, and then filtering,
also colors brown.</p>

<p><i>Peroxide of hydrogen</i> bleaches organic substances,
dark or red hair being thereby changed to reddish-yellow
or pale blonde. The coloration, or rather bleaching,
does not appear at once, but is complete only after some
time. The peroxide of hydrogen only exists in aqueous
solution, which should be quite concentrated (15 to 20
per cent.). Owing to the mode of preparation, the solution
always contains some nitric acid and readily decomposes,
when exposed to light and air, whereby it
becomes useless.</p>

<p>In the following, a number of formulæ for hair-dyes
are given. According to their constitution, they may
be divided into two groups, viz: A. Dyes which contain
the coloring matter in a finished state; and, B.
Dyes which are formed upon the hair by a chemical
process. The dye should first be applied in a dilute
state, and the application repeated in case the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
shade is not produced, since by the use of the dye in a
concentrated form a shade not resembling any natural
color might be obtained, hair which is to be colored
black acquiring, for instance, a metallic blue-black
lustre.</p>


<p>A. <span class="smcap">Single Hair Dyes.</span> <i>Teinture Orientale (Karsi).</i>&mdash;Ambergris
2&frac34; drachms, gall-nuts 4 lbs., pulverized iron
1&frac34; ozs., pulverized copper 1 drachm, musk 1 drachm.
Convert the gall-nuts to a fine powder, and roast the
powder in an iron pan, stirring constantly until it is
dark brown to blackish. Rub the powder together
with the metallic powders, and the perfume substances
and keep the mixture in a damp place. For use moisten
some of the powder upon the hand and apply to the
hair, rubbing it in vigorously. In a few days the hair
acquires a deep black, quite natural color. In roasting,
the tannin-substances contained in the gall-nuts are converted
into gallic and pyrogallic acids, which yield with
the metals combinations of a deep black color, and are
even readily converted into black-brown bodies (humin
bodies).</p>

<p><i>Teinture Chinoise (Kohol).</i>&mdash;Gum-arabic 1 oz., Chinese
ink 1&frac34; ozs., rose-water 1 quart. Reduce the gum-arabic
and Chinese ink to fine powder, and triturate
the powder in small quantities with rose water until a
homogeneous black fluid free from grains is formed.
Collect this fluid in a bottle and mix it with the remaining
rose water. Kohol is only suitable for persons
with black hair and is especially used for dyeing the eyebrows.
The coloring matter of this preparation consisting
only of carbon in a very finely divided state, it
is perfectly harmless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Potassium permanganate hair dye.</i>&mdash;Potassium permanganate
5 ozs., distilled water 2 quarts. Crystallized
potassium permanganate dissolves with great ease in
water to a deep violet fluid. By bringing the solution
in contact with an organic substance&mdash;paper, linen, skin,
horn, hair&mdash;it rapidly discolors, imparting to the substances
a brown color, which originates from peroxide of
manganese. Free the hair from fat by washing, and
apply the dilute solution with a soft brush. The color
appears immediately, and according to the degree of
dilution, all shades of color from blonde to darkest
brown may be produced with this perfectly harmless
agent. It may, of course, also be used for dyeing the
beard.</p>

<p><i>Bismuth hair dye.</i>&mdash;Subnitrate of bismuth 10 parts,
10 per cent. solution of potassa and citric acid each a
sufficient quantity, glycerin 150 parts, water sufficient
to make 300 parts. Intimately mix the subnitrate of
bismuth and the glycerin by trituration, then heat the
mixture in a water-bath, and gradually add to it solution
of potassa, under constant stirring, until the bismuth
salt is dissolved. Next add a concentrated solution
of citric acid until only a slight alkalinity remains.
Finally add enough water to make 300 parts, and perfume
according to preference.</p>

<p><i>Walnut hair dye.</i>&mdash;Bruise 40 parts of fresh green
walnut peel with 5 parts of alum, digest with 200 parts
of olive oil until all moisture has been dissipated, strain
and perfume the oil according to preference.</p>

<p><i>Pyrogallic hair stain.</i>&mdash;Pyrogallic acid &frac12; oz., water 3
ozs., alcohol 1 oz. This liquid gives a dark brown
color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">Double Hair Dyes.</span>&mdash;These and similar hair
dyes consist of two preparations, kept in bottles I and II.
The bottle II, which serves for the reception of the silver
preparation, must be of blue or black glass, since silver
salts are decomposed by light. For use, pour some of
the fluid in bottle I into a cup, and moisten the hair
with it by means of a soft brush. Then pour the fluid
in bottle II into another cup, and apply it with another
brush.</p>

<p><i>For dyeing brown.</i> I (in the white bottle).&mdash;Liver of
sulphur 7 ozs., alcohol 1 quart. II (in the dark bottle).
Nitrate of silver 4 ozs., distilled water 1 quart.</p>

<p><i>For dyeing black.</i> I (in the white bottle).&mdash;Liver of
sulphur 8 ozs., alcohol 1 quart. II (in the dark bottle).&mdash;Nitrate
of silver 5 ozs., distilled water 1 quart.</p>

<p>Liver of sulphur is a leather-brown mass, readily
soluble in water. The solution has to be filtered before
it is brought into the bottles. By bringing the solutions
together black sulphide of silver is formed, which effects
the dark coloration of the hair. After using the dye, a
disagreeable odor of stale eggs adheres to the hair, which
is, however, readily removed by washing.</p>

<p>The silver hair dyes may also be made by preparing
the fluid in bottle II as follows: Add drop by drop water
of ammonia to the silver nitrate, kept constantly agitated
until the precipitate formed is redissolved.</p>

<p><i>Tannin hair dye.</i> I (in the white bottle).&mdash;Pulverized
gall-nuts 14 ozs., water 16 ozs., rose water 16 ozs. Boil
the gall-nuts in the water, strain the boiling fluid through
a close cloth into the rose water, and bring the fluid thus
obtained, while still hot, into the bottles, which should be
immediately closed. (It is absolutely necessary to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the fluid hot into the bottles, as otherwise mould is readily
formed.) II (in the dark bottle).&mdash;Nitrate of silver 5
ozs., distilled water 1 quart. Add water of ammonia to
the silver solution until the precipitate at first formed is
redissolved.</p>

<p><i>Melanogène.</i> I (in the dark bottle).&mdash;Nitrate of silver
5&frac12; drachms, distilled water 2&frac34; ozs., water of ammonia
1 oz. II (in the white bottle).&mdash;Pyrogallic acid &frac12;
drachm, 40 per cent. spirit of wine 17 ozs.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Eau d'Afrique.</i> I (in the dark bottle).&mdash;Nitrate of
silver 1&frac12; drachms, distilled water 3&frac12; ozs. II (in the
white bottle).&mdash;Sodium sulphide 4&frac12; drachms, distilled
water 3&frac12; ozs.</p>

<p><i>Krinochrom.</i> I (in the white bottle).&mdash;Pyrogallic
acid 5&frac12; drachms, distilled water 6&frac14; ozs., alcohol 5&frac12; ozs.
II (in the dark bottle). Nitrate of silver 6&frac34; drachms,
water of ammonia 2 ozs., distilled water 10&frac12; ozs.</p>

<p><i>Copper hair dye.</i> I (in the white bottle).&mdash;Potassium
ferrocyanide (yellow prussiate of potash) 7 ozs., distilled
water 1 quart. II (in the dark bottle).&mdash;Cupric
sulphate (blue vitriol) 7 ozs., distilled water 1 quart.
Add to the cupric sulphate solution water of ammonia
until the pale blue precipitate at first formed is dissolved
to a beautiful dark blue fluid. This hair dye gives a dark
brown color, but great care has to be exercised in its
use, the yellow prussiate of potash being very poisonous.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Depilatories.</span>&mdash;While the number of agents for promoting
the growth of the hair is a very small one, and
their efficacy not above doubt, there are, on the other
hand, quite a number of very effective agents for
the removal of hair, sulphur combinations being most
frequently used for the purpose. <i>Rhusma</i> is a depila<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>tory
which has long been known, and is still almost
exclusively used in the Orient. It consists of 1 part
orpiment and 6 parts of lime slaked to a powder. Mix
intimately by passing the ingredients through a sieve,
and preserve the mixture in tightly-closed vessels. For
use, stir some of the powder to a paste with water, and
apply it to the place upon which the hairs are to be
destroyed. As soon as the layer of paste begins to dry
remove it with a thin shaving of wood. Owing to the
energetic action of this depilatory upon the skin, ladies
are advised not to use it for the face.</p>

<p>Combinations of sulphur with the alkalies and alkaline
earths are much used as depilatories. Of these,
<i>sodium sulphydrate</i>, however, should never be used, without
the advice of a physician, as it acts very energetically
upon the skin, and frequently leaves scars behind. <i>Calcium
sulphide</i> is contained in Boettger's depilatory. It
is usually prepared by heating at a low red heat in a
securely-closed crucible an intimate mixture of 100
parts of finely-powdered quicklime with 90 parts of
precipitated sulphur. Of the calcium sulphide thus obtained,
mix 1 lb. with 8 ozs. of starch and 7 drachms of
lemon oil. Apply the paste to the place upon which
the hairs are to be destroyed, allowing it to remain 20
to 30 seconds. The action of <i>barium sulphide</i>, which
is frequently used as a depilatory, is much less energetic
than that of calcium sulphide. It is, for instance, a
constituent of Bartholow's depilatory, which consists of
barium sulphide 1 part, caustic lime 1 part, and starch
2 parts, made into a paste with alcohol.</p>

<p class="subh">COSMETICS.</p>


<p>Under this heading will be considered toilet vinegars,
washes, perfumed powders, pastes, skin pomades, as well
as paints.</p>

<p>The fabrication of cosmetics is an important branch
of perfumery. The materials used for the purpose
should be selected and of good quality even for cheap
articles, which are, of course, also represented in the following
receipts.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Skin Cosmetics.</span>&mdash;<i>Toilet vinegars.</i>&mdash;Perfumed vinegars,
when added to wash water, have a refreshing effect
and are also used as fumigating agents by mixing them
with water in a dish and placing the latter in the room.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Vinaigre de Bully.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best quality 10 quarts,
tinctures of orris root, tolu balsam, benzoin and storax,
each 1 lb., olibanum tincture &frac12; lb., vanilla tincture and
best lavender oil 5&frac14; ozs., bergamot oil and lemon oil
each 4&frac14; ozs., acetic acid 2 lbs.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Vinaigre de toilette à la rose.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best quality
5 quarts, benzoin tincture 1 lb., angelica tincture 8 ozs.,
<i lang="fr">extrait rose</i> No. 1, 1 lb., French rose geranium oil 3&frac12;
ozs., acetic acid 14 ozs.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Vinaigre de toilette à la violette.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best
quality 5 quarts, orris-root tincture 2 quarts, tinctures
of benzoin and storax each 7 ozs., bergamot oil 2&frac12; ozs.,
liquid orris-root oil<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> 11 drachms, acetic acid 1 lb.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>
<p><i lang="fr">Vinaigre de toilette héliotrope.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best quality
5 quarts, tinctures of orris root and vanilla each 1 quart,
musk root tincture 3&frac12; ozs., benzoin tincture 1 lb., bergamot
oil 1&frac34; ozs., verbena oil and palmarosa oil each 14
drachms, clove oil 8&frac14; drachms, acetic acid 1 lb.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Vinaigre de toilette orange.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best quality
5 quarts, benzoin tincture 10&frac12; ozs., abelmosk tincture
and vitivert tincture each 8 ozs., civet tincture 14
drachms, Portugal oil 8 ozs., acetic acid 14 ozs.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Vinaigre de toilette.</i>&mdash;Alcohol of best quality 10 quarts,
orris-root tincture 1⅗ lbs., tinctures of benzoin, tolu balsam
and angelica each 1 lb., French rose-geranium oil
1&frac34; ozs., bergamot oil 4&frac14; ozs., lemon oil and lavender oil
each 3&frac12; ozs., neroli oil 8&frac14; drachms, best rosemary oil 11
drachms, peppermint oil 5&frac12; drachms, acetic acid 2 lbs.</p>

<p><i>Aromatic vinegar.</i>&mdash;Tincture of benzoin 1 oz., alcohol
1⅛ oz., acetic ether and extract of jasmine each 1&frac12; ozs.,
acetic acid 3&frac12; ozs., oil of rose 10 drops, oils of neroli and
wintergreen each 5 drops.</p>

<p><i>English aromatic vinegar.</i>&mdash;Crystallized acetic acid 20
ozs., camphor 2 ozs., oil of lavender 10 drops, oil of
cloves 30 drops, oil of cinnamon 15 drops. Mix and
dissolve.</p>

<p>The preparation is used for smelling-bottles. The
vials are first filled with sulphate of potassa in small
crystals, and enough acetic acid is added to thoroughly
moisten the salt. The use of sulphate of potassa is
said to have originated from the fact, that the acid mixture
was formerly obtained by introducing into the
vials acetate of potassa and a sufficiency of sulphuric
acid. Whether this be true or not, sulphate of potassa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
constitutes an excellent medium for retaining the liquid
in the bottle. It acts simply as an incorrodible sponge.</p>

<p><i>Toilet vinegar.</i>&mdash;Essence of bergamot 20 drops, essence
of ambergris 4 drachms, essence of vanilla and
oil of neroli each 30 drops, strong acetic acid 160 drops,
alcohol 6 ozs.</p>

<p><i>Washes.</i>&mdash;Washes are mostly milky fluids or emulsions,
formed by the fine division of resins or balsams
in water, benzoin and myrrh being especially employed
for the purpose. Of the former, it was at one time
believed that fumigations with it every evening after
washing would prevent wrinkles in the face. The emulsions
are used by adding one to two tablespoonfuls to
the wash-water. Perfumed glycerin is also much employed
as an addition to wash-water.</p>

<p><i>Virginal milk</i> (<i lang="fr">Lait virginal</i>).&mdash;Alcohol of finest
quality 2&frac12; quarts, bergamot oil and Turkish rose oil
each 5&frac12; drachms, benzoin tincture 1 quart.</p>

<p>Pulverize in a porcelain mortar about 14 drachms of
sugar, add the bergamot oil and rose oil and mix intimately.
Now bring the paste-like substance into a
glass bottle, rinse out the mortar with the alcohol and
add the latter to the contents of the bottle. Close the
latter with a well-fitting stopper and place it in a warm
room for 8 days, shaking frequently. Then add the
benzoin tincture, mix intimately and finally filter
through paper. This fluid is used by adding sufficient
of it to the wash-water to form an emulsion, which
exerts a refreshing and invigorating effect upon the skin
and olfactory nerves.</p>

<p><i>Rose milk</i> (<i lang="fr">Lait de rose</i>).&mdash;Rose water 5 lbs., white bees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>wax
and comminuted Castile soap each 3&frac12; ozs., potash
4&frac12; ozs., <i>Extrait rose</i> No. 1 8 ozs.</p>

<p>Heat the rose-water in an enamelled or porcelain vessel,
and dissolve in it the Castile soap. Then add the wax,
and, when this is dissolved, the potash, stirring constantly,
while the substances are dissolving. When
solution is complete, strain the milk-like fluid through a
cloth (best gauze or muslin) into another vessel, cover it
and allow it to cool. When cold add the <i>Extrait rose</i>,
shake thoroughly and fill it into bottles for sale.</p>

<p>If the <i lang="fr">Lait de rose</i> is to be rose color, add very carefully
a small quantity of corallin tincture and shake
vigorously.</p>

<p>Besides wax, fatty or oily substances should not be
employed in the preparation of these emulsions, as
otherwise they would soon become rancid.</p>

<p><i>Almond milk</i> (<i lang="fr">Lait d'amandes amères</i>).&mdash;Distilled water
5 lbs., bitter almonds 1 lb., white beeswax 1&frac34; ozs., comminuted
Castile soap 2&frac12; ozs., potash 3&frac12; ozs., bitter-almond
oil 8&frac14; drachms, dissolved in extract from <i>Pomm.
Tubereuse</i> 8 ozs.</p>

<p>Scald and peel the bitter almonds. Then convert
them to a paste by pounding in a clean mortar, bring
the paste into the distilled water, and extract in a water-bath
for about &frac12; hour. Then strain the liquid through
a cloth, successively dissolve the other substances in the
strained fluid in the water-bath, and when all is dissolved,
strain again and proceed as given for rose milk.
The bitter-almond oil is dissolved in the extract from
<i>Pomm. Tubereuse</i> and added last of all to the liquid
mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lily milk</i> (<i lang="fr">Lait de lys</i>).&mdash;Rose water, orange-flower
water, and jasmine water each 1 quart, white beeswax
3&frac12; ozs., Castile soap 2&frac12; ozs., potash and orris-root tincture
each 3&frac12; ozs., cumarin tincture 1&frac34; ozs., dissolved in
musk-root tincture 3&frac12; ozs., bergamot oil 1&frac34; ozs. Proceed
as given for <i lang="fr">Lait de Rose</i>.</p>

<p>In regard to the Castile soap, it may here be remarked
that it should be neutral and contain no excess of oil, as
otherwise all the preparations above given might, in a
short time, become rancid.</p>

<p><i>Perfumed glycerin with rose odor.</i>&mdash;Chemically pure
glycerin of 28° B. 10 lbs., <i>Extrait rose</i> No. 1, 8 ozs.</p>

<p>By adding the <i>Extrait rose</i>, the glycerin becomes turbid,
but clarifies by shaking thoroughly and allowing
the mixture to stand quietly for several days. Filtering
the fluid is not advisable, and besides entirely useless.</p>

<p><i>Perfumed glycerin with fruit odor.</i>&mdash;Chemically pure
glycerin of 28° B. 10 lbs., any kind of fruit ether 1&frac34;
ozs. Shake thoroughly. The glycerin, if chemically
pure, is not rendered turbid by the fruit ether, which,
of course, must also be of the best quality.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Perfumed Meals and Pastes.</span>&mdash;The perfumed
meals are frequently used for washing in place of soap,
or they are applied after washing, or shaving, to the skin
to prevent the latter from becoming rough or chapped.
The pastes are applied in order to make the skin softer.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Farin de noisette</i> (<i>nut meal</i>).&mdash;Best quality wheat flour
3 lbs., almond meal 1&frac12; lbs., orris-root powder 1 lb., bergamot
oil 2 ozs.</p>

<p>Mix the ingredients intimately and pass the mixture
through a fine sieve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p><i lang="fr">Farin d'amandes amères</i> (<i>almond meal</i>).&mdash;Best quality
wheat flour and almond meal each 3 lbs., bitter-almond
oil 1 oz.</p>

<p>Mix the ingredients intimately and pass the mixture
through a fine sieve.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Pate d'amandes au miel</i> (<i>honey almond paste</i>).&mdash;Best
quality almond meal 2 lbs., honey 4 lbs., chemically pure
glycerin of 28° B. 2 lbs., fresh olive oil 4 lbs., bitter-almond
oil 1&frac34; ozs., the yolks of 20 eggs.</p>

<p>Sift the almond meal into a capacious earthenware
dish. Mix the honey and glycerin after slightly warming
them. Beat the yolks of the eggs in a small dish
with a tablespoon until a uniform mass is formed. Now
add alternately of the mixture of honey and glycerin and
of the olive oil to the almond meal, work the whole
thoroughly with the pestle, then add the yolks of the
eggs, stirring constantly, and finally the bitter-almond
oil. The whole now forms a viscous mass. It is best
to keep the freshly-prepared paste in a well-closed
earthenware pot in a cool place for about 14 days before
distributing it into boxes, because after the ingredients
are mixed together a slight fermentation takes place
which might cause damage by bursting the lids of the
porcelain boxes.</p>

<p>Ladies use this paste for producing a fine soft skin,
upon the hands, face, and neck, for which, in fact, it
has proved excellent.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Poudre de riz à la rose.</i>&mdash;Rice flour 4 lbs., prepared
talc 19 ozs., <i>Extrait rose</i> No. 1, 3&frac12; ozs., French rose-geranium
oil 14 drachms, clove oil 2&frac34; drachms.</p>

<p>The ingredients are intimately mixed and passed
through a sieve. The perfumes are brought together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
a glass and thoroughly shaken. The same directions
hold good for all succeeding receipts for <i lang="fr">Poudre de riz</i>.
Of talc only the whitest pieces should be used, the
Briancon talc or French chalk being very suitable for
the purpose, it yielding a very white and delicate powder.
It is prepared as follows: Over 1 part of talc pour 2
parts of vinegar, let it stand, with frequent shaking, for
14 days, then filter and thoroughly wash the talc with
distilled water.</p>

<p>If rose-colored <i lang="fr">poudre de riz rose</i> is demanded, add to
the proportions of weight above given about 1 oz. of
madder, triturate it thoroughly with the powder, perfume,
triturate again, and finally pass the whole through
a fine sieve.</p>

<p>These rice powders are best kept in well-closed tin
canisters.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Poudre de riz héliotrope.</i>&mdash;Rice flour 4 lbs., prepared

<p>Proceed as directed for <i lang="fr">Poudre de riz à la rose</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cold Creams and Lip-Salves.</span>&mdash;The purpose of
cold creams and lip-salves is to impart lustre to the skin
and protect it from cracking in changes of temperature.</p>

<p><i>Cold cream.</i>&mdash;Fat-almond oil 3 lbs., spermaceti 5&frac14; ozs.,
white beeswax 7 ozs., best rose water 1 quart, bergamot
oil 14 drachms, Turkish rose oil 5&frac12; drachms.</p>

<p>Melt in a porcelain dish in the water-bath, first the
spermaceti and wax, then add the almond oil, and when
the whole forms a liquid allow the previously warmed
rose water to flow in slowly, stirring constantly. Now
take the dish from the water-bath, and with a large
spoon of silver or horn stir the mass until it begins to
thicken. Then stir in the perfume and fill the finished
cold cream in boxes.</p>

cucumber juice is slightly warmed, the rest of the process
being the same as with cold cream.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Glycerin gelée.</i>&mdash;Gum-tragacanth 5&frac12; drachms, swelled
up in rose water 10&frac12; ozs., chemically pure glycerin of 28°
B. 7 ozs., honey 3&frac12; ozs., <i>Extrait rose</i> No. 1, 1&frac34; ozs.</p>

<p>Convert the gum tragacanth to a coarse powder, bring
the powder into a capacious glass flask, pour the rose
water upon it, and, after corking the flask, let it stand
for about 3 days, shaking it frequently and vigorously.
Then strain the swelled gum tragacanth, which now represents
a thick fluid, through a white cloth or fine-meshed
sieve into a dish, and after adding the glycerin, honey,
and <i>Extrait rose</i>, mix the whole intimately, and fill the
tubes or glasses with the finished preparation. It is an

spirits of lavender and bergamot each 1 oz.</p>

<p><i>Boroglycerin cream.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 1 part of boric acid in
24 parts of glycerin; add to this solution 5 parts of
lanolin and 70 parts of petrolatum. This preparation
is said to be excellent for chapped hands, lips, etc.</p>

<p><i>Récamier cream.</i>&mdash;The following formula is said to
produce something quite similar to this preparation:
zinc oxide 4 ozs., glycerin 13 fluid drachms, water 5
fluid drachms, spirit of rose (4 drachms to 1 pint) 1
fluid drachm.</p>

<p><i>Preparations for chapped hands.</i>&mdash;I. Quince seed 2
ozs., rose water 16 ozs., glycerin 32 ozs., tincture of
benzoin 2 ozs. Macerate the quince seeds in the rose
water 24 hours, strain, and add the glycerin and benzoin.</p>

<p>II. Balsam of Peru 1 drachm, purified wool fat 1
oz. Perfume to suit.</p>

<p>III. Menthol 1.5 parts, salol 2, olive oil 2, lanolin
50. Apply twice daily. The pain soon ceases, the
skin softens and the chaps quickly disappear.</p>

<p>IV. Quince seed 1&frac12; drachms, boric acid 4 grains,
carbolic acid 10 grains, glycerin 2 ozs., alcohol 3 ozs.,
cologne 2 ozs., oil of lavender 20 drops, glycerite of
starch 2 ozs., water sufficient to make 1 pint. Dissolve
the boric acid in 8 ozs. of water, macerate the quince
seed in the solution for three hours and then press
through a straining cloth, add the glycerin, carbolic acid
and glycerite of starch and mix thoroughly. Mix the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
cologne and oil of lavender with the alcohol, add the
solution to the mucilage and mix the whole well.</p>

<p><i>Wash for the hands.-</i>-Tannin 8 grains, glycerin 5
drachms, rose water 4 ozs. Mix and filter. The hands
should be washed with soap in soft water, or water to
which a little borax has been added, thoroughly dried
and then well rubbed with the lotion.</p>

<p><i>Nail-powder.</i>&mdash;The following preparation serves for
the purpose of imparting smoothness and lustre to the
finger nails. For use apply some of the powder to a
piece of soft glove-leather and rub the nails until they
show lustre.</p>

<p>Stannic oxide (putty powder) 2 lbs., carmine 5&frac12;
drachms, oils of bergamot and lavender each 2&frac12; drachms.
Rub the stannic oxide as fine as possible and mix it in
the mortar with the other ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Lip-salve</i> No. 1.&mdash;<i>Pomm. Rose</i> No. 24 or 30, 8 ozs.,
best carmine nacarat 2&frac12; drachms.</p>

<p>Convert the carmine to a fine powder and thoroughly
triturate it with the <i>Pomm. Rose</i> in a porcelain mortar
until no more specks of carmine are perceptible. By
this trituration the salve becomes very soft and delicate,
so that it can be conveniently pressed into the small
boxes. A pleasing lustre is then imparted to the surface
of the salve by carefully moving each box to and
fro over the flame of an alcohol lamp. It may here be
remarked that carmine nacarat is the best coloring matter
for lip-salve, it being far more resistant than, for instance,
alkannin, which, in contact with the skin, readily
acquires a bluish coloration.</p>

<p>If lip-salve of a more solid consistency is desired, the
object may be attained by the addition of a few drachms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
of white beeswax. However, in this case, the pomade
must be melted in a water-bath, or the pomade and wax
melted together. Then add the carmine, stir until cold,
fill into boxes and make the surface lustrous over an alcohol
flame.</p>

<p><i>Lip-salve</i> No. 2.&mdash;<i>Pomm. Rose</i> No. 6 or 12, 10&frac12; ozs.,
<i>Huile antique rose</i> No. 6 or 12, 14 drachms, white beeswax
5&frac12; drachms, carmine nacarat 2&frac34; drachms.</p>

<p>Melt the wax in a porcelain or enamelled vessel, then
add, first, the oil, combine it with the wax, then add the
pomade and finally the carmine. When all this is intimately
mixed, stir it until cold. The further process is
the same as given for No. 1.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Paints.</span>&mdash;The object of paints is to hide blemishes of
the skin and to impart to it a different color&mdash;as a rule
a youthful one&mdash;from that bestowed by nature, though
under certain conditions, especially in the case of actors,
they are also employed for the purpose of changing the
expression of the face. A distinction is made between
pulverulent, solid, liquid and fat paints.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pulverulent Paints</span> (<span class="smcap">Powders</span>).&mdash;The simplest
powder is wheat starch. It forms a dull white powder
with a bluish lustre, and is perfectly harmless. Powdered
talc, prepared in the manner previously described
(p. 330), is also much used for powder. By mixing 100
parts of prepared talc, while still moist, with 12 parts
of spermaceti, previously rubbed to a moist powder
with some rectified alcohol, and drying at a moderate
heat, a product known in commerce as "Blanc fard,"
or "Blanc français," is obtained.</p>

<p>Talc by itself not furnishing a beautiful white, it is
mixed, according to circumstances, with <i>subnitrate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
bismuth</i> (<i>flake-white</i>), <i>magnesia</i>, <i>chalk</i> or <i>zinc-white</i>.
<i>White lead</i>, though frequently used, cannot be recommended,
it being injurious to health. Subnitrate of
bismuth furnishes the best white; it has, however, the
disadvantage of turning brown in air containing sulphuretted
hydrogen. Zinc-white does not have this defect,
but lacks the lustre and pure white color.</p>

<p>Customary mixtures for powders are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Carbonate of magnesia and wheat starch each 5
parts, prepared talc 15, zinc-white 10.</p>

<p>II. Carbonate of magnesia and chalk each 5 parts,
prepared talc 15, subnitrate of bismuth 20.</p>

<p>The powders are prepared in three colors: white,
rose-color and yellowish. To heighten the white color
the powder is mixed with about ⅓ of one per cent. of
ultra-marine. For rose color some carmine is used, and
for coloring yellowish some carmine and yellow ochre.</p>

<p>A powder for coloring more intensely red is prepared
as follows: Mix 100 parts of prepared talc with 2.5 or
more parts of carmine, according to the desired shade
of color. The carmine is triturated by itself and in
small portions added to the talc. It should not be
dissolved, as given in many directions, in ammonia, it
losing thereby its fiery red. To obtain an especially
delicate powder, the finished article should be carefully
bolted through silk.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Solid Paints.</span>&mdash;Solid paints may be prepared from
the above-mentioned powders by stirring them to a paste
with thin gum solution.</p>

<p><i>Ordinary red paint</i> (<i>rouge</i>).&mdash;Prepared talc 2 lbs., carmine
1 oz., gum-tragacanth mucilage prepared from distilled
water 3&frac12; ozs. and gum-tragacanth 2&frac14; drachms, best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
olive oil 5&frac12; drachms, best alcohol 1 oz., spirits of sal
ammoniac &frac12; tablespoonful, distilled water as much as
required.</p>

<p><i>Fine red paint</i> (<i>rouge</i>).&mdash;Prepared talc 2 lbs., carmine
1&frac12; ozs., gum-tragacanth mucilage prepared from distilled
water 3&frac12; ozs. and gum-tragacanth 2&frac14; drachms, best olive
oil 5&frac12; drachms, <i>Extrait rose</i> No. 1, 1 oz., spirits of sal
ammoniac &frac12; tablespoonful, rose water as much as required.</p>

<p><i>White paint.</i>&mdash;Prepared talc 2 lbs., gum-tragacanth
mucilage prepared from distilled water 3&frac12; ozs. and gum-tragacanth
2&frac14; drachms, best olive oil 5&frac12; drachms, <i>Extrait
rose</i> No. 1, 1 oz., rose water as much as required.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned paints may be filled in small
porcelain boxes, which must, however, be hermetically
closed to prevent drying out. To obviate the latter,
the paints may be mixed with glycerin, which must,
however, be carefully done so that the mass does not
become liquid; too much glycerin may also make the
paint blue.</p>

<p>Regarding the preparation of these paints, the following
may be said: The prepared talc is passed through a
fine-meshed sieve into a porcelain dish. The carmine is
rubbed fine in a porcelain mortar and then triturated
with water<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> in the same mortar until no more specks of
carmine are visible. Now add the dissolved carmine to
the talc in the porcelain dish, stir thoroughly with a
horn or wooden spoon, and gradually add sufficient rose
water to form a dough-like mass. Then add to this
mass about 1&frac34; ozs. of gum-tragacanth mucilage, pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>pared
3 or 4 days before from 2&frac14; drachms of pulverized
gum-tragacanth and 3&frac12; ozs. of water, work the
mass thoroughly through, and add the 5&frac12; drachms of
best olive oil. The oil being also incorporated with
the mass, mix in the 1 oz. of <i>Extrait rose</i> or alcohol,
and again work the mass thoroughly through, when the
paint is ready to be brought upon porcelain plates.</p>

<p>The procedure is now as follows: By means of a
spoon bring a quantity of the paint, about the size of
three hazelnuts upon the centre of a porcelain plate,
spread it out uniformly to the edge of the plate by
knocking the latter against the table, and in the same
manner cover 6 or 8 plates. These are the test-plates.
Tie a piece of paper over the dish containing the rest
of the paint and set it aside. Place the plates coated
with paint in a dry place to dry, but do not expose them
to sunlight, nor should soaps be kept in the room, as in
both cases the paint would become blue. After 12 to
18 hours the paint upon the plates will be dry, and now
comes the most difficult part of the manipulation. With
a small horn-knife or the sharp edge of a playing card
scrape off very carefully and uniformly a small quantity
from the surface of the paint, proceeding from the
edges towards the centre of the plate. Then, to see
whether the paint adheres firmly to the plate, knock the
edge of the latter quite vigorously against the table. If
it adheres firmly, cover the entire plate with a piece of
watered silk, catch the ends of the latter beneath the
plate with the left hand, and, with the palm of the right,
run quite hard over the silk. By this means the moiré
of the silk is imprinted upon the paint, giving it a nice
appearance. Proceed in the same manner with the six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
or eight test-plates, and if the paint upon them bears
the manipulation without dropping off, work up the rest
of the paint in the dish. If, however, the paint does
not adhere to the plates, it is proof of it containing not
enough gum-tragacanth. In this case add some of the
mucilage to the paint in the dish, work it thoroughly
through, and proceed in the manner described. Packing,
labelling, etc., being subject to fashion, need not
here be described, but as the charm of novelty contributes
much to the sale of an article, the manufacturer
should make it his business to invent new attractive designs,
without too much imitating others.</p>

<p><i>Red stick-paint</i> (<i>Stick rouge</i>).&mdash;Prepared talc 1 lb.,
carmine 5&frac12; drachms, olive oil 2&frac34; drachms, alcohol 8&frac14;
drachms, spirit of sal ammoniac a good teaspoonful,
distilled water and gum-tragacanth mucilage as much as
required.</p>

<p>The mode of preparation is the same as for solid
paints, except that in order to give the rouge more consistency,
less water and gum-tragacanth mucilage are to
be used.</p>

<p>For moulding the rouge into sticks, round tin moulds
about 2&frac12; inches long and of the thickness of a finger
are used. To facilitate the removal of the rouge
sticks, the inside of the moulds is rubbed with a rag
moistened with olive oil and wrapped around a thin
stick of wood. After removing the sticks from the
mould, they are allowed to dry superficially, and next
wrapped first in tissue paper and then in tinfoil, one
end, however, being left free from paper and tinfoil.
They are finally labelled and packed in paste-board boxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p><i>White stick paint</i> is prepared in the same manner as
stick rouge, with the exception that the carmine is omitted.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Rouge en feuilles.</i>&mdash;Prepared talc 1&frac34; ozs., carmine 2&frac34;
drachms, olive oil 10 to 15 drops, spirits of sal ammoniac
about 50 drops, pure alcohol 5&frac14; ozs., distilled water
or rose water 8 ozs., gum-tragacanth mucilage 1&frac34; ozs.</p>

<p>The carmine is first rubbed fine, then the olive oil,
spirits of sal ammoniac, and gum-tragacanth mucilage
are successively thoroughly triturated with the carmine,
next the talc is added, then the water, and finally the
alcohol. Mix all intimately in a mortar with the pestle.
The whole forms a fluid which, by means of a fine brush,
is applied to a square piece of white card board, so that a
circular disk the size of a silver dollar lies in the centre
of the paper. The application of the rouge to the paper
has to be repeated three or four times, allowing one layer
to dry before applying the next. When the last layer is
dry, the rouge is smoothed by laying a piece of tissue
paper upon it and running the broad side of a paper
cutter over the tissue paper. In packing, a piece of
tissue is laid between the separate pieces.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Liquid Paints.</span> Liquid paints are chiefly used by
actors.</p>

<p><i>Liquid rouge.</i>&mdash;Rose water 1&frac12; quarts, carmine 1&frac34; ozs.,
<i>Extrait rose</i> No. 1, 1 lb.</p>

<p>Heat the rose water, without allowing it to boil, in a
glazed earthenware vessel, add the carmine, previously
rubbed fine, to the hot rose water, and stir the fluid with
a clean wooden spatula until the carmine is completely
divided. Then take the vessel from the fire and add
a tablespoonful of spirits of sal ammoniac. The latter
imparts to the rouge a brighter red, but not too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
of it should be used, as otherwise the rouge acquires a
bluish shade, and besides the odor of the spirits of sal
ammoniac is not exactly agreeable. When the rouge is
cold add 1 lb. of <i lang="fr">Extrait de rose</i>, mix the whole intimately,
and filter through white filtering paper into a
clean glass bottle. The rouge has to be protected from
sunlight.</p>

<p><i>White liquid paint.</i>&mdash;Fine zinc-white 3 lbs., rose water
or orange water 3&frac12; quarts.</p>

<p>In a clean enamelled vessel boil the zinc-white in 5
quarts of distilled water, stirring constantly, until about
3 quarts of the water are evaporated. Then take the
vessel from the fire and allow the fluid to stand quietly
for &frac12; hour. Then carefully decant off the supernatant
water, pour the 3&frac12; quarts of rose water or orange water
upon the zinc-white, stir thoroughly, and fill in bottles.</p>

<p><i>Fat paints.</i>&mdash;Fat paints of various colors and shades
are prepared chiefly for the use of actors. The ground
mass consists of <i lang="fr">Blanc fard</i> or <i lang="fr">Blanc français</i>, or simply
of pulverized talc bolted through silk. It is colored,
according to the color desired, with carmine, eosin,
sienna, lamp black, or aniline colors, and incorporated
in the proportion of 1&frac12; ground mass to 1 fatty mass,
with the fatty mass consisting of white wax 3 parts and
olive oil 7 parts; <i>or</i> paraffin 1&frac12; parts and white vaseline
2 parts. The fatty mass is melted in the water-bath,
the powder stirred in, and after allowing the
mixture to cool somewhat, it is perfumed and poured
into tin tubes previously slightly warmed.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned <i>fat paints in sticks</i>, there
are also <i>fat paints in porcelain boxes</i>, which are of a somewhat
softer consistency. They are prepared in white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
rose color, and yellowish. A few receipts for them are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Crême de Lys.</i>&mdash;Melt 3&frac12; ozs. of spermaceti and 7 ozs.
of white wax in the water-bath, and after taking the
mass from the fire mix it with 3⅕ lbs. of subnitrate of
bismuth, previously rubbed fine, with 1⅘ lbs. of almond
oil. Then allow to cool somewhat, next stir until entirely
cold, and perfume.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Crême de rose.</i>&mdash;Spermaceti 3&frac12; ozs., white wax 7 ozs.,
<i lang="fr">Blanc Français</i> 3⅕ lbs., carmine 8&frac14; drachms, almond oil
1-4/5 lbs.</p>

<p>Proceed as directed for <i lang="fr">crême de lys</i>.</p>

the water-bath than necessary for the evaporation of the ether.</p></div>
